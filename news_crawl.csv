They may imagine futuristic concept cars, owning a vehicle which can take them to work while they relax, or hailing a robotaxi, but the core idea remains the same.
 
However, we know that self-driving technology will be instrumental in shaping the future of more than personal travel. Public transport, shipping and even flying vehicles have realised the benefits of a driverless model for some time now. Still, none make such a good business case as logistics.
 
 
Why is logistics an area with such potential for driverless technology?
On a very basic level, logistics holds incredible potential because of the sheer number of miles the industry clocks up. Plus, the industry is changing in ways which requires companies to innovate in order to stay competitive. Where once business to business (B2B) delivery made up a majority of the sector’s activity, now business to consumer (B2C) has taken the lead. Covid-19 boosted ecommerce sales, and therefore delivery, by 30% too. That figure is unlikely to drop back to its pre-Covid level.
 
Last mile delivery from depots to front doors has therefore taken up a larger share of the market and a diverse range of customers must be considered when it comes to cost. For example, though 25% of us are willing to pay a premium for services like same-day delivery, around 70% will always choose the cheapest option. For logistics businesses, drivers are an incredible expense and prevent 24/7 operation – the cheapest option, therefore, is to go driverless. McKinsey predict that up to 80% of parcels will be delivered by an AV within the next decade.

The business case for self-driving technology in this sector has always been recognised by developers as there are opportunities along the entire supply chain. In late 2019, for example, an autonomous freight truck demonstrated how reduced delivery time could work to benefit business outcomes. It autonomously delivered butter over 4,500 km from California to Pennsylvania in 3 days in inclement weather. A similar trip with a human driver would normally take nine days.
 
Reduced cost makes the tech appealing for businesses, but the sector is equally appealing to manufacturers. With no on-board passengers, risk is invariably reduced. Plus, such vehicles are more likely to operate in controlled environments like depots and warehouses, making the manufacture of AVs fit for logistics a little simpler: there are less traffic participants and they are aware of the AVs moving about; routes are limited and exactly mapped. This makes the whole environment much more predictable and hence easier to manage for the AV.
 
 
How will the AWARD consortium move driverless logistics forward?
All this is enough of a reason to pay special attention, and give a special boost, to this area of autonomous mobility. A project co-ordinated under the European Commission’s ‘Horizon 2020’ programme, The All Weather Autonomous Real logistics operations and Demonstrations (AWARD) consortium aims to move autonomous logistics forward by enabling the deployment of safe autonomous transportation systems in a variety of different scenarios.
 
Made up of 29 partners, including Continental, EasyMile, Applied Autonomy and more, the group hopes to address some of the biggest hurdles in the area so that commercial enterprises might put the technology, processes and policy recommendations to good use. Vitally, this investment will put specific focus on how autonomous heavy-duty vehicles can run real-logistics operations in harsh weather conditions. That will have incredible knock-on effects for the industry at large.
 
 
How significant is weather in making logistics self-driving?
Weather is crucial to the performance of autonomous vehicles, and it remains an obstacle which developers are struggling to overcome. Its inclusion in AWARD’s programme is vital to the success of developing self-driving logistics vehicles of any sort as any which venture outside a warehouse must be able to continue operation beyond the driest, sunniest months.
 
Getting AV development out of the lab, beyond the prototype stage and into testing in real world environments is the key. This has been done in some places, and some have even shared their findings in an attempt to push the tech forward, but most road tests for AVs are still carried out in fair weather conditions.
 
Extensive real world testing is a necessity as, on their own, conditions like rain and snow are not necessarily prohibitively difficult for AVs to navigate. However, the transition between phases of different conditions is difficult for AVs to master, though manufacturers like Continental are making progress. AWARD, and the trials it is set to undertake over the next three years, may be key to advancing solutions for not just self-driving freight, but all driverless vehicles.
 
It’s because of this potential that the AWARD consortium presents such an exciting step forward for driverless in this sector. As the industry which perhaps stands the most to gain from speedy implementation of self-driving solutions, logistics is an interesting area for the programme to focus on and presents a great chance of achieving actionable results.
 
The collaboration of AWARD, which draws on knowledge from 29 partners across Europe, is indicative of what is needed across the wider industry. It’s only through cooperation that we can hope to realise the true potential of driverless tech.

What might surprise most, though, is the fact that we’ve been anticipating the arrival of AVs for over 80 years now. So, where does the history of driverless really begin?
 
Past: Visions of automation
 
The concept of a driverless vehicle was first shared with the public on a grand scale at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. At this event, focused on technologies of the future, the idea of automated highways, where cars travelled in trench-like tracks was first introduced. By 1957, the concept had developed further and a popular US advert modelled the future of travel on AVs, creating that iconic image of a family playing a board game as their car drove itself along the highway.
 
These early presentations of AVs showcase the opportunities the yet to be created tech could create. A year later, in 1958, the real work began. General Motors and RCA teamed up to develop prototype automated highways, going down the smart roads route to achieve their driverless vision.

A decade on, in 1968, Daniel Aaron Wisner, an RCA engineer, created the first system to put an electronic device in control. He named it ‘Automotive Electronic Cruise Control’, though we now refer to it as just cruise control. German automotive manufacturers, Continental, took a huge leap forward the following year, in 1969, as their technicians successfully modified a passenger car to follow a circular track without a human driver. But even though an AV wasn’t their aim (it was all to better test their tires), the images of a driverless car circling the track as if steered by a ghost, further fuelled people’s imagination.
 
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, progress sped up. In 1977, the Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Lab in Japan made the first intelligent car which could navigate by tracking white road markers and reached speeds of up to 32km/h. In 1978, Bosch made a major leap and introduced an important driver assistance feature: the first Anti-locking Braking System. In 1982, we got more familiar with AVs in popular culture as Knight Rider introduced a self-driving self-aware car to the small screen with ‘KITT’.
 
By 1986, the desire to see self-driving on our roads had grown and Prometheus, the largest automated driving project to this day, was designed to help us get there. Starting out with an automated van, over the next nine years the project made huge progress, culminating in the 1,758km journey of a Mercedes S-Class from Munich to Copenhagen, and back. The vehicle covered up to 158km at a time without human intervention and even reached speeds of up to 175km/h. This was made somewhat simpler when our connectivity capabilities grew with the widespread adoption of the internet in 1993.
 
In 1995, The Electronic Stability Program, which reduced skidding and put safety in the hands of an automated system, hit the market and was closely followed with the launch of GPS. When the tech went live as an optional extra in the Oldsmobile 88, a car which cost just over $2,200, it opened up a wealth of new possibilities for the development of AVs.

Present: Getting connected
Since the turn of the century, focus in the world of driverless vehicles has switched to tech. Though there is still plenty of scope for imagining what the driverless future may look like, the reality of autonomous driving is coming much closer, and that is all down to innovation.
 
Back in 2003, Toyota began to address a universal pain point for drivers and offered the first parking assist system as an optional extra. It made hands-free parking a reality in Japan and quickly, across the world. As automated features became more common, DARPA launched a ‘Grand Challenge’ to increase the capabilities of fully autonomous vehicles. However, in the first challenge, in 2004, none of the vehicles entered managed to complete the 150-mile unassisted.
 
A little later, however, we saw that AVs could cover decent distances. In 2010, The University of Parma’s VISLAB successfully sent four autonomous vehicles on a journey from Parma to Shanghai, covering nearly 16,000km. From that year, huge investments were made in the tech. Google X – the software giant’s semi-secret research facility – launched its self-driving car project that year. They’ve now clocked up over one million miles.
 
From 2010 to now, new developments have arrived rapidly. From 2012 to 2015, dynamic mapping made an entrance. Continental’s ‘eHorizon’ and ‘Connected Horizon’ from Bosch both began to integrate topographical and digital map data with sensor data.
 
In 2015, Daimler and Mercedes Benz tested their Future Truck 2025, reaching speeds of 80 km/h while driving autonomously on Germany’s autobahn. In the same year, Mercedes Benz wowed audiences at CES 2015 with its sleek, hydrogen-electric, self-driving concept car and by 2016, more automated features were ready for launch. Traffic jam assist was developed, promising drivers they can take their hands off the wheel when stuck in queues and by 2018, parking assist had become smarter – now it could look out for spaces for you.
 
In the same year, cameras began to replace mirrors, providing better visibility, a better view and increased connectivity. By 2020, Augmented reality (AR), which allows virtual information to appear out your front window, became a real possibility. Road Departure Protection systems came into effect in 2020 too, executing active road keeping in emergency situations and showcasing how automated functions might improve road safety.

Future: Mass expansion
Progress isn’t stopping there. Technology is moving forward as developers from every part of the growing industry are entrenched in the, rather laborious, steps towards creating a driverless future. Lots of people are eager for that future to arrive, but there is an incredible amount of work to be done to make it happen. So though driverless vehicles are yet to arrive on a mass scale, they are on their way.
 
Major breakthroughs are predicted for vehicle to everything (V2X) communication, meaning cameras, sensors and backend data might allow vehicles to know their environment by 2024. From around 2023 to 2025, we expect Level 2+, hands-free driving to be available on highways and parking will become a breeze from 2024. At that point, cars will be able to find a space and park themselves without any human interaction beyond the instruction to park.
 
In 2025, highway autopilot is predicted to arrive. That means Level 4 control which allows drivers to ‘switch off’ should be an option on highways and it will likely be popular – some predictions assume there will be 250,000 autonomous cars on the road by then.
 
As different levels of autonomous travel become available, experts expect that driving zones which separate vehicles with different capabilities will be introduced from 2025 onwards. With those precautions in place, forecasters see 54 million autonomous cars on the road by 2035. And by 2040, predictions suggest that the adoption of autonomous vehicles will have decreased the number of road accidents we see today by up to 80%.
 
Trucks will get in on the action by 2040 too. Long convoys of freight vehicles (“platoons”) are expected to dominate highways and within a decade, all cars will have some level of driverless function. Self-parking will become the norm too and will likely reduce the space we need for storing our vehicles by up to 75% by 2050.
 
So, what happens after 2050? That’s simple. We enter a fully automated driving world.

Rarely do we ask how AVs might change our countryside. But, as it turns out, there are enormous opportunities for, and developments in, autonomous tech in agriculture.
 
Back in 2019, we reached out to a group of farmers to hear what they thought about the oncoming automation of farming. Though each had their reservations about the tech, there was a sense that the introduction of driverless machines was inevitable. Gary Trueman, an ex-dairy farmer who now owns a pasture holding in Lincolnshire, England, said it was simply “impossible to avoid.”
 
A few years on, it’s becoming clear that he was absolutely right. In almost every process which takes place in the agricultural sector, we can now see autonomous technology making inroads. Though heavy-duty machinery like the tractors and combines we associate with rolling countryside have used driver assistance features for some time, and continue to advance with trials and testing, development looks beyond tractors alone.
 
Why is autonomous tech so useful in agriculture?
 
Targeted technology like John Deere’s ‘Seed and Spray’ drone-like device provides solutions to specific problems and reduces the need for both human direction and labour. This machine, for example, is able to find and treat weeds within a set perimeter autonomously, and it does so much faster than a human team could. Plus, it will only become more capable with the imminent rollout of 5G.
 
Debbie Vale, a multi-disciplined farmer with experience in both the UK and New Zealand, talked of using drones to perform tasks such as herding sheep when we last spoke. Autonomous machinery like this just takes that idea one step forward. It builds on well-established principals too.

Read more of what our farmers had to say in Autonomous agriculture – the future of farming?





The first autonomous tractor was developed back in 1969 and most farmers are familiar with the advanced GPS mapping and driver assistance features the majority of new models boast. Autonomous versions are now in operation on commercial farms around the globe and offer benefits including 24-hour operation, advanced obstacle detection, tandem operation and more. Despite what some our farmers thought, autonomous vehicles also promise to improve safety in what is often a high-risk environment.
 
Will driverless change the nature of farming?
 
That said, and as with many driverless vehicles, cost limits how such technology may be used. As Gary explained in 2019, ""Big corporate farms will likely embrace any new technology if it helps increase profits in some way. Smaller farms will have technology fed down to them over, most likely, decades, so the impact will be slower.”
 
Inevitably then, while costs remain high, driverless tech will cause a rift within the agricultural community. While that clearly puts larger operations at an advantage, it’s not necessarily bad news for farmers with smaller holdings. Timothy Berry, an organic beef farmer and former dairy farmer from Devonshire, England, explained that such a divide would simply force smaller farms to embrace their niche and specialise in particular, most likely low-tech, methods. This might ultimately help smaller holdings become more profitable as premium products can charge premium prices.
 
Can autonomous tech solve agriculture’s ‘people problem’?
 
Time, energy and passionate agricultural workers could be freed up for such enterprises by the continued implementation of self-driving farm vehicles. By allowing AVs to complete the most strenuous and least appealing jobs, the dwindling agricultural workforce could be put to better use. 
In 2015, the Hands Free Hectare Project set out to show exactly how that could be achieved. To do that, one hectare of farmland was worked for a full year using just small, autonomous machines. In that time, no human even set foot onto the land being worked. Since then, the project has successfully harvested two seasons of grain using only using autonomous machinery, including tractors and drones. If such projects could be expanded, or such methods replicated on a larger scale, it could provide a strong solution to the people problem in agriculture.
 
Of course, there are reservations until new tech is proven safe, efficient and effective and while initial costs for such technology remain high, all but the largest commercial farms will be cut out of these new opportunities. Plus, there is an argument to be made that increasing reliance on automated tech may create a new people problem in agriculture. Reliance on advanced technology, it’s been suggested, might prompt those with site-specific knowledge and understanding of often overlooked, but vitally important, practices like soil management leave the industry. Will the people who are passionate about driverless tech in agriculture be as concerned about proper maintenance of land and livestock? It’s yet to be seen.
 
Still, driverless tech will change the way many farms operate - with fewer people on site, increased yields, more targeted use of chemicals, even new opportunities for green initiatives such as rewilding unused land. For all those reasons, agricultural AVs seem to provide a positive way forward.
 
What do you think? Will autonomous tech trickle down from large commercial projects to smaller farms? Will the people on the ground be responsible for adoption of AVs? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

There's every chance you've thought it too: will driverless cars mean I can drink and 'drive'? Especially during the festive season, and with autonomous driving getting more and more mainstream-coverage with every passing week, it's no doubt the thought is becoming more and more prevalent. And seeing as many of us enjoy a tipple, and often resent having to stick to the soft drinks when it's 'our turn', it's undoubtedly crossed most people's minds more than once.
Especially on New Year's Eve, when taxis and hotels cost three times their usual price – and that's if you're smart enough to book in advance. The idea of enjoying a messy night out and not worrying about how everyone is going to get home safely, and cost-effectively, must be appealing.
But is it a realistic dream?

What is 'drunk driving'?
When you 'drunk drive' you don't necessarily have to be 'drunk'. You simply must have ingested enough alcohol to feel the effects. And, turns out, you don't need much at all. 
Alcohol is a drug acting as a ""nervous system depressant"" which, according to Drug Science means it: ""works by slowing down parts of the brain. Areas that it affects include those that control inhibition, thought, perception, attention, judgement, memory, sleep and coordination."" This can result in the user being more animated, relaxed and social – but it comes at a serious cost. And the higher the level of blood-alcohol concentration, the higher the cost.
The negative effects of alcohol are never more apparent, or more deadly, than when driving. The Alcohol Rehab Guide says: ""any amount of alcohol in your bloodstream can impact your driving ability. Safe driving requires the ability to concentrate, make good judgements and quickly react to situations. However, alcohol affects these skills, putting yourself and others in danger.""
The effects of alcohol on driving can be summarised as the slowing of reaction times, reduced coordination and concentration, blurred vision, and inhibited judgement.
Different countries have different limits on how much is 'too much', but it's almost globally frowned upon. Countries such as Armenia, the Czech Republic, Jordan and Romania have a total ban in place, with other countries such as China, Sweden and Japan following closely behind, with a 0.02% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit – 20 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. This is a level easily achieved with a few sips of an average-strength alcoholic beverage. Despite this, and how well documented – and criminalised – drunk driving is, it is still very commonplace globally.






      image: istockphoto.com
    




The consequences of drunk driving
The penalties for drink driving differ from country to country. In the UK, for example, you could face up for 6 months imprisonment, an unlimited fine and a driving ban for at least a year. And, if you cause death by dangerous driving, you could face up to 14 years behind bars. And that's if you aren't the casualty.






      image: shutterstock.com
    




Despite the fact cars are getting safer, and their passengers less likely to be killed in a collision, fatalities are still depressingly commonplace, with alcohol as a very common cause.
According to Forbes, South Africa has the biggest number of driving deaths: ""with 25.1 deaths per 100,000 people every year. Shockingly, nearly 6 out of every 10 fatalities (58%) on South Africa's roads can be attributed to alcohol consumption.""
Canada and the United States follow that, with 34% and 31% of road fatalities attributed to alcohol, with 10,497 deaths in in the US in 2016. That's roughly 28 people a day – and that doesn't take into consideration those who survived with serious life-altering injuries.
The driverless difference
Thankfully, most people don't drink and drive. But, as the statistics show, it's still a global problem. Whether it's legal or not, some people will take the risk – and sometimes the consequences will be disastrous.
Driverless cars are likely to reduce the number of casualties significantly. An AI will be more capable of piloting a vehicle than a fully sober person, let alone a person under the influence of alcohol.
But is it likely to ever become legal to drink and drive – even if the vehicle drives itself.
Well, the answer isn't straightforward, or even fully decided. As it stands, according to the current levels of autonomy, everything up to Level 5 (i.e. full autonomy) still requires a human driver for some input. They must be legally able to drive – which includes completely sober.
There has been a recent incident with the Tesla S's Level 2 autopilot function, in which a driver in San Francisco was found ""passed out"" at the wheel, two times over the legal limit. Thankfully nobody was hurt, but the driver did excuse his behaviour by saying that the car was ""in Autopilot"" when he was arrested.






      image: continental.com
    




It's obvious that, for everything up to Level 5, the normal drink driving rules will apply. This means someone will have to still act as the 'designated driver', even if they don't do much actual driving. But what about fully autonomous vehicles? As it stands, the answer is currently firmly in the region of academia.
When lawyer John French spoke to CoventryLive, a publication in the city famous for producing, and testing Jaguar Land Rover's autonomous vehicles, he was positive about its possibility:
“There is no law at present stating if you are in a fully autonomous motor vehicle that you are exempt from drink driving rules. However, it appears to make perfect sense that an individual being driven in a fully autonomous vehicle cannot be a ‘driver’ in any sense of the word or be ‘in charge’ of the vehicle and is merely a ‘passenger’ – i.e. akin to being in the back of a taxi.""
The National Transport Commission in Australia, which is currently preparing Australian driving laws for driverless vehicles, has also argued in favour of an exemption – but only if there is “no possibility that a human could drive"" the vehicle in question. 
Not adding this exemption could make the public reluctant to warm to the technology in its entirety, as the report went on to say:
“To hold the human responsible may restrict the introduction of automated vehicles into Australia and unnecessarily deny or delay the many potential benefits of the technology.” 
We're still some distance from fully autonomous cars being a possibility, mostly due to infrastructure and legality. But, when that day comes, experts seem to think that they could be exemptions drink driving laws – or at least there should be.
But what do you think? Would you feel safe getting into an autonomous vehicle when over the legal limit this New Year’s Eve – or beyond? Join the debate and let us know your thoughts. 
In the meantime, please drink responsibly, take care of each other and take a taxi home.









From all of us at 2025AD we wish you a merry Christmas and a very happy new year! We are taking a short break over the festive season, but will be back in January 2020 with fresh and exciting news, features, expert opinions and social polls for all things driverless and global.
See you then!

It’s no longer all that difficult to imagine autonomous vehicles on our roads, and it’s easier than ever to see how the myriad features AVs will include might change our lives. So much media attention is now focused on not how or when AVs will arrive, but the features that will make individual models stand out.
Despite that, safety remains the most important factor for potential owners and users. Does that mean we’re reluctant to let go of the steering wheel and put technology in charge? Or do we just need a little more reassurance?To answer those questions, 2025AD conducted a piece of research, hoping to gain insight into what ordinary people really think about driverless technology. After carefully compiling a list of queries, we sent a detailed questionnaire out into the world via online media and received over 1,000 responses from self-selected individuals across Germany. This is what the numbers told us…
 
Safety will always be concern number one









It’s undeniable that to trust a driverless vehicle, users need to be reassured that it is safe. Safety has always been the number one topic when it comes to driverless tech and it’s still one of the most discussed topics on our own platforms. That was reflected in our research where the top disadvantage for a driverless future was safety, with 37% of respondents seeing it as a major concern.
 
Safety features were among the most important too. 42% prioritised forward-collision braking and another 33% wanted to see in-car emergency assistance. These results show that most are concerned about how machine-driven vehicles will match up to human-controlled ones when it comes to safety. But we must recognise that in many situations those machines are already better drivers than us – human error still accounts for 90% of road accidents and driver assistance systems have continuously lowered the number of traffic fatalities over the years.
 
Young people will be the first to trust AVs completely









In our research, it was confirmed that age plays a major role in how much we’re willing to trust driverless tech. Those under 25 were consistently the most positive about a driverless future, with 62% of our respondents aged 16 to 24 willing to own or rent an AV. For comparison, only 39% of those aged 25 and over were eager to do the same. This younger demographic is naturally more willing for an AV to do the driving, independently or with users able to take over when needed, while they’re on board too.
 
Surprisingly, this hints at a standard acceptance curve. With most technology – just think of smartphones or social media – a few innovators are the first to welcome new developments and get on board very early. We can already see this with driverless. Then younger generations like our surveyed under 25s, and usually those with a higher social status, are early adopters. The tech then spreads into the mainstream as it becomes more common, more affordable and better understood by older generations. Young people might be the first to accept AVs, but we can expect the curve of wider acceptance to follow this regular pattern.
 
What will convince us to accept AVs?









There is already proof that driverless cars are safer than human-driven ones, but convincing potential users to trust the technology is not necessarily as simple as it might seem. In our research, time in the market was most important to potential users, with test reports coming in a close second. This suggests that more testing, the release of those results and a growing body of driverless models will increase trust.
 
Therefore, though some are trusting the technology less as it becomes more real, manufacturers are already on the right road. To ensure any model is safe, millions of hours of test driving must be completed both physically on public roads and in test areas, and virtually. This is now an established route to market and, as the tech gains new opportunities to prove itself in real life rather than simulation alone, wider audiences should come to have confidence in AVs.
 
In the end, then, it’s down to OEMs to prove the value of their technology. And they must prove it in the real world, not only in virtual tests and fabricated test cities, however effective they may be, for real people to have faith in their results.
 
Let us know what you think in the comment section below. Would you trust a driverless vehicle based on what you know right now? Is safety still your greatest concern? What would give you the confidence to trust the tech completely?

We talk about cities which are taking great leaps forward with autonomous tech and exciting new ways to make sure driverless vehicles are safe. But we mustn’t ignore the fact that, for many, driverless is an unwanted development.
 
To better understand how people feel about autonomous vehicles right now, 2025AD conducted a piece of research which drilled down into not just whether respondents wanted to see driverless transport become a reality, but their concerns and hopes for the tech too.
 
After carefully compiling a list of queries, we sent a detailed questionnaire out  via online media and received over 1,000 responses from self-selected individuals across Germany. Though there has been a real push for the advancement of AVs in Germany, it is also known as a nation of motorists and that was certainly reflected in our results. According to our survey, 59% simply don’t want to own, or even rent, a driverless vehicle any time soon.
 
Opposition isn’t new









Such resistance to self-driving tech has been a feature of the landscape since the first developments were made some time ago, but it’s interesting that so many are still opposed to the technology. In one study, 61% confessed they would rather ride in a human-driven vehicle than an AV and a poll in California found 74% feel the same. In addition, 59% of our respondents said they wouldn’t pay anything extra for driverless capabilities on a new car, suggesting such features are unwanted, or at the very least are not considered to be a priority.
 
Older drivers are more resistant to AVs









Among the group who are not in favour of autonomous vehicles, our study showed 55% were aged 55 or over. This suggests that there is an age divide when it comes to accepting driverless. Another study has revealed that those over 65 are 17% more likely to trust a human driver over an AV than those under 24.
 
This seems to mirror generational trust in, and acceptance of, new technologies more generally and suggests that younger generations will be the early adopters of self-driving vehicles. But it is also worth noting that even younger generations are more comfortable with active assist features, rather than vehicles which are capable of driving with no human input.
 
Losing the joy of driving









Perhaps one of the most interesting details to come out of our research was the fact that 43% of this AV-resistant audience see the biggest disadvantage of autonomous vehicles as losing the joy of driving. In contrast, just 15% of those eager to go driverless considered this a disadvantage.
 
For experienced drivers, it’s important to consider AVs as not just a new technology, but the marker of a significant shift in the culture of car consumption. Over the years, the automotive industry has worked hard to make our vehicles to be seen as personal expressions of freedom, choice and control. Altering that understanding, particularly if drivers are expected to shift to a driverless rented model of transport, will require an extensive programme of both research and action. Right now, that’s not in place.
 
Can this audience to be convinced?









To gain full acceptance of the tech, this audience would need to be convinced of AVs’ efficiency, safety and benefits. According to our survey, the best way to do that is through time in the market (23%) and test reports (17%).
 
We should note here that a significant 47% responded ‘none of the above’, suggesting nothing could change their minds, but at the same time, 100% of this audience claimed they would pay extra for features like automated parking or automatic speed limit application when buying a new vehicle. Of course, such features don’t make an AV, but such open acceptance of automated capabilities suggests that time in the market, and increasing familiarity with driverless, may be enough to prompt significant changes in attitude.
 
Our acceptance of self-driving varies according to all sorts of variables. Our research suggests that age is a significant factor, but some of us are just not open to the change. It will be an enormous shift. But, at least for those who are unsure of the tech, it will be made in increments with growing acceptance of driver assistance systems paving the way for fully fledged AVs. 
 
Some hesitation is to be expected, especially while questions and concerns around safety remain. But we have to consider the cultural and social status of the car too – driving is an important activity and even self-expression for so many, and owning a particular vehicle is important to even more. AVs may strip that away. Could this be the hurdle which is hardest for manufacturers to overcome?
 
 
Share your thoughts with us in the comments below. Do you think there’s any way to change the mind of someone who is opposed to driverless? Is age the biggest factor in determining whether we support AVs or not?

But these concerns are usually centered on the safety of the passengers and pedestrians from the cars themselves. There has been considerably less focus on the impact driverless cars could have on the safety of people on the streets – from other people.
But are driverless vehicles likely to make us safer from other on-street dangers?







            photo: shuttershock.com
          





Urban versus driverless
Cities are sure to feel the driverless impact first. And, as the inhabitants of cities are usually at greater risk becoming victims of crime, its set to be where the impact of driverless technology on street crime is likely to be felt.
 
With more journeys likely to take place in it's possible that street crime has the potential to drop. This is due to less opportunity for public aggression, drunkenness, assault and the everyday activities associated with urban living – something every city in the world has in common.







            photo: shuttershock.com
          





Let's look at the risks posed by the cars themselves.   occur on roads around the globe each year. Ordinary pedestrians face risks that are often caused by momentary lapses of attention.
 
With planners building advanced cyber solutions, tracking devices and routes that will ensure a direct journey home, human error should eventually be replaced by AI, or sensors, which can't be distracted. This will hopefully lead to an increase in street safety by getting people off the streets where they could otherwise come to harm.
 
Stranger danger
Autonomous vehicles may also enable journeys . If, for instance, you have enjoyed a tipple (or five), or have been working late, getting home safely may be a little more likely with the assistance of a machine.
 
The safety stats are a little difficult to predict, but it's very likely people will feel safer. With notable cases such as that of John Worboys, the taxi driver who was imprisoned for assaulting dozens of women in London, strangers in the driving seat still pose an unknown threat to some. The autonomous vehicle could remove that threat, providing a door-to-door, dedicated and personalized journey home.

No more last bus home
Travelling alone means the potential for attracting aggression, including on public transport. With driverless tech, there will be more options available, so people could avoid catching the last bus home. Rushed, uncomfortable and unsafe journeys on public transport could well become a thing of the past.
 
Instead of having to deal with unwanted attention by intoxicated individuals, or opportunist criminals, automated vehicles could swoop in and usher people home, away from any potential confrontation, simply by reducing their time on the street. A higher level of safety could also be achieved through in-car surveillance and data sharing, with keener focus on dangerous cities such as Rio de Janerio and Mexico City and their problematic neighborhoods.
 
On the beat
What about police time? Well, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, self-driving cars will not require so much policing time, potentially cutting forces in half.
 
In the US, up to 42 per cent of all police interactions with citizens are traffic-related. It can only be assumed that, if driverless vehicles form the majority, there will be less need for forces on the roads tackling speeding, drunk-driving or other traffic violations. This means that they could be free to turn their attention to other things, such as policing the streets, as opposed to the roads.
 
Drunkenness has always been a problem – and probably always will be. But, with automated vehicles, there is less risk of people getting behind the wheel illegally.
 
'Think fast' moments
The Uber and Waze apps calculate routes in real time and often redirect down obscure side streets to avoid congestion. This could make for an increase in risk when not on popular, more public routes. For the planners involved in creating and managing driverless technology, any issues on the streets could effectively be re-routed with more advanced sensors – taking a person away from danger quickly, if needed.
 
There is even an argument that autonomous cars could enable transportation to become free. This would contribute to a new level of safety and convenience being available for the many, not just the few.

Self-driven ""grand theft auto""
Then comes the question of a different type of security. Powered entirely by computers, driverless vehicles will also house more advanced security measures than their regular counterparts, in the physical realm and the cyber. Driverless vehicles fall into the Internet of Things (IoT), meaning they constantly communicate with other devices to run in a worthwhile way.
 
With installed GPS tracking, individuals looking to deprive others of property would not be able to power an autonomous vehicle, even if they had somehow gained access to it. Similarly, a the owner could have the function  to remotely shut down a car if they were made aware that it had been stolen, rendering it useless. They could then retrieve the GPS data so the the police could take over.
 
The bottom line
With the industry constantly evolving, what is important to one person, service or demographic, will be less so to another. Needs and wants will constantly evolve, as will the environments this technology will be used in. The bigger picture will be hard to determine until the technology is in regular use.
 
Until that day comes – stay safe out there.
 
Join the debate! Is driverless tech likely to have an impact on street crime, or will it have the opposite effect?

            photo: https://istock.com
          





New documents from the National Transportation Safety Board, released on the 5 November 2019, have revealed that the automatic braking feature that comes as standard with the car model in question, were shut off by Uber to avoid 'interference' with its self-driving testing on public roads.
 
The first driverless fatality
As we reported shortly after the incident took place, on 18 March 2018 the 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg was hit and killed by an Uber-operated Volvo XC90 as she pushed her bicycle across a dark and busy intersection in Tempe, Arizona. It was the first time a pedestrian had been killed
 
The car had been retrofitted with driverless cameras, sensors and software by Uber and was in the process of being tested. It failed to slow down or stop as the woman crossed, and the 'safety driver' was unable to act in time. The crash led to Uber immediately halting their testing of driverless vehicles in Arizona, San Francisco, Toronto, and Pittsburgh, with a full enquiry launched.
 
The driver, and Uber, were quickly cleared of any wrongdoing when it quickly came to light that it was a software failure that led to the woman not being 'seen', or at least, not being 'seen' as a pedestrian. 







            photo: shuttershock.com
          





The new NTSB findings
Further details have emerged since, wherein it became apparent that the system didn't realise pedestrians could 'jaywalk', meaning 'cross illegally'. Elaine crossed 100 yards from a 'crosswalk', which explains why the car failed to detect her correctly despite having 5.6 seconds to react. It identified her as another vehicle, and not a pedestrian.
 
The NTSB investigators have since released information which has turned some of the attention back to Uber. Most modern cars, including the XC90, have a factory-equipped automatic emergency braking feature which kicks-in in situations where the driver is distracted, or fails to break in 'good time'. This was, ahead of the driverless testing phase, overridden by Uber so it wouldn't interfere with the system, or the testing.
 
Volvo have since run tests which emulated the circumstances of the collision and have found its system should have prevented, or at least lessened, the impact, as the NTSB reported: “[the SUV] would have avoided the collision with the pedestrian in 17 out of 20 variations — the pedestrian would have moved out of the path of the SUV.”
 
However, Uber were more than likely right to shut off this system. Experts consulted on the case have since said it made 'technical sense', as it would have been ""unsafe for the car to have two software 'masters'.""
 
So yes, this ultimately means the driverless system was at fault. Not Uber, and not the safety driver – who was cleared when it was determined that Herzberg 'appeared from the shadows' in such a way that reacting in good time would have been very difficult for her. 







            photo: www.shuttershock.com
          





The aftermath
Mistakes have been made, and lessons have been learned. New software has been developed – by Uber, by Volvo and by other driverless tech companies – to ensure humans and vehicles have clear distinctions, no matter how they use the roads. But there's still the matter of public trust to settle.
 
According to Wired:
 
""On November 19, the NTSB will hold a meeting in Washington, DC, on the incident. Investigators will then release a comprehensive report on the crash, detailing what happened and who or what was at fault. Investigators will also make recommendations to federal regulators and to companies like Uber building the tech outlining how to prevent crashes like this in the future.""
 
Aside from the Tesla ‘autopilot crash’ of 2016, which killed the driver, Herzberg was the first and, to date, the only  'uninvolved' victim of a self-driving vehicle. But, as public road testing is stepped up, the potential for more is statistically increasing. But does that mean autonomous driving will be abandoned as a possibility?
 
In the original article about the crash, we called upon a previous 2025AD interview with Professor Armin Grunwald, a renowned technology assessor for the German parliament. He said:
 
“At some point, this complex technology in some specific situation will have a malfunction and cause an accident. And people will be harmed by it. This will spur debates. Then we will need to look at the overall statistic: currently, humans are responsible for more than 90% of all accidents. If autonomous driving can reduce a large proportion of those road deaths, the public will accept it. Even if the systems fail occasionally, it is not likely that people will reject the technology as a whole.
 
Grunwald went on to predict: “if autonomous driving can reduce a large proportion of those road deaths, the public will accept it.”
 
Join the debate! Is this likely to happen again, or have the driverless technology companies learned their lesson?

Cities like Barcelona, Bristol and even Trondheim in Norway have all seen autonomous tech edge into the public domain this year. Soon, flying cars will be doing the same. That tech has taken huge leaps forward since air taxis were launched in Dubai in 2017 and many are pledging to develop flying cars even further. 
 


Back in January we looked at how autonomous vehicles could optimise the largest human migration and we’ve seen how Covid-19 has become a catalyst for the development of autonomous driving too. For better or worse, the pandemic has changed how we navigate our world and driverless vehicles are a huge part of that equation. 
 


And there have been more positives over the year. After years of waiting, subscription-based models are finally here so we can choose to rent a car, not buy it. Could that give us more options in 2021 and beyond? Plus, finally, the connectivity we need for AVs to become a common sight has arrived. 5G became available to the public this year, and we’re beyond excited to see where it goes next. 
 


Take a deep dive into the year’s biggest stories with our in-depth articles and watch our film to get the low-down on 2020 in the world of autonomous driving.

As a result, there is a huge mix of assumptions about AVs out there. But are all those ideas grounded in the actual users’ reality as we now know it, or are they hangovers from the days when self-driving was the stuff of science fiction?
 
To find out more, 2025AD has conducted research to gain insight into what ordinary people really think about driverless technology. After carefully compiling a list of queries, we sent a detailed questionnaire out into the world via various online media and received over 1,000 responses from self-selected individuals across Germany. So, what did they have to say?
 
 
Will autonomous vehicles reduce our downtime?
We’ve written before about AVs becoming workspaces and ‘working’ often appears in lists of what we’ll do in AVs, so it makes sense that many assume driverless cars will leave us even less time for rest. Going driverless will free up a huge amount of time for anyone who travels regularly, so it’s unlikely those extra hours will be spent on just one activity, but users seem inclined to devote travel time to anything but work. In our study, 30% said they’d actually use the spare time to relax.
 
Of course, there may be some disconnect between what people say and what they would actually do. Yet a recent study in Bangladesh which measured activities undertaken in chauffeur-driven cars against the same subjects’ ambitions for AVs found that the two matched up almost perfectly. So perhaps there is good reason to believe that if people say they would relax – and using social media, sleeping and listening to music all scored highly in that study – they will do just that.









Will flashy features determine which models are most popular?
Now that there are plenty of AVs out there, the differences between them are becoming clearer and the features we’re seeing in driverless concept cars suggest that infotainment and comfort or design elements are becoming more important.
 
But, according to our survey, practicality, and the features which ensure it, is still the biggest draw for most. When assured that safety would be guaranteed, nearly 30% prioritised practicality over all else, showing that what’s most important in human-driven vehicle purchases, namely safety and efficiency, remains at the top of the list when it comes to AVs too. Flashy features are just a bonus.









Are men more prepared to go driverless?
The answer, it seems, is yes. Existing research finds that women are less eager to adopt driverless tech as they tend to be more wary of potential safety concerns. That’s evident in other surveys, where more women (79%) than men (62%) have admitted to feeling uncomfortable with the idea of riding in an AV and more (53% to 32%) have expressed a preference for riding with a backup driver.
 
Our study supports this split, but suggests that, with time, the gap between genders is narrowing. Where the previously mentioned research, all conducted pre-2019, found a significant divide, in our results that has reduced to just 12 percentage points. Now 47% of men readily accept driverless, as do 35% of women . In the place of gender, age is becoming a more significant factor as young people across the board are now more open to using AVs than their older counterparts.
 
 
Will the future of travel be shared?
While human-driven cars have followed a model of personal ownership, it’s assumed that the dawn of driverless will disrupt that. Robo-taxis which are ‘always on’ and public transport shuttles for shorter journeys are expected to reinvent mobility, reducing congestion, making travel more efficient and removing the obstacles (such as high initial costs) of vehicle ownership.
 
The outbreak of a global pandemic has undoubtedly changed our approach to shared transport. Our survey, conducted towards the end of 2020 while Covid was still at the front of our respondents’ minds, found that, of those eager to ride in an AV, 66%   would prefer to own rather than rent. But, with our cars parked 95% of the time and shared AVs offering benefits when it comes to the environment, cost and convenience for consumers, it still looks like ‘only the wealthy and fussy will bother to buy a car’.
 
 
Will trust in self-driving tech be built with time?
Principally, yes. However, there are limits to how much time alone will build confidence in driverless tech. For example, research shows that people are most willing to use AVs in controlled environments and least willing in areas with high pedestrian traffic or when there are no manual controls. Our trust, then, is directly linked to risk.
 
Nonetheless, 22%  of our survey respondents, the largest percentage for a single response, said time in the market will be the most important proof of safety, suggesting that reliability is key. Another 20% would also look to test reports for reassurance though, far more than would trust recommendations from friends or celebrity endorsement. Manufacturers, then, must share their successes, and their failures, if we are to rely on AVs without hesitation.









There’s no question that the conversation around driverless tech is multi-faceted and ever expanding, so it’s difficult to find the one truth. However, our findings seem to support the idea that self-driving cars won’t be a sure-fire success as more than half of the respondents plainly stated they would currently not be interested. And that’s despite the fact that more and more driver assistance systems have saved thousands and thousands of lives over the past decades. Building trust through performance will be the key.
 
In our upcoming articles, we’ll take another look at our survey and discover more about what it will take for us to trust the technology and why some may never be convinced of the benefits of autonomous transport.
 
So, what do you think? Will the dawn of AVs reduce our downtime, or would you use the free time to relax? Would you rather buy or rent an AV? Is time all it will take for you to trust driverless tech? Let us know in the comments below.

*** We also have a german translation of this page available. Read it here! ***
 
Whether you love, hate or are otherwise ambivalent to motorsport – you can't deny its influence. Competitive racing is a global powerhouse, and its impact on the technology we go on to use in our day-to-day lives is paramount to progress. But could that be the case for driverless technology too? Or is the idea of racing cars without racing drivers a little too 'far out', or even too 'safe' to be exciting?
 
To know for sure, we could look to a recent example of progressive, contemporary tech being used in a traditional racing format: Formula E.
Electric to driverless…a race too far?
When you think of motorsport, chances are you think of Formula One first. Well, the fifth series of Formula E, the all-electric answer to Formula One, has recently come to an end. It was originally conceived to show the world that electric vehicles were not only a sensible next step in the racing world – in terms of reducing emissions and the overall environmental impact – but also a completely viable and life-integrable choice for the rest of the world too.

When it was first conceptualised in 2011, the ABB FIA Formula E Championship was met with scepticism and even criticism. It was quickly dismissed as a gimmick by the racing community. But, since its first series in 2014, it's gone from strength-to-strength, attracting fans in both the public, and in big automotive brands – a clear indication of its growing global reputation and commercial viability. 
It's been an interesting human experiment too, with many Formula One racing drivers, including Lucas di Grassi switching to all-electric for their racing and, some cases, personal use. It's helped electric vehicles take off, in every conceivable way

The electric tech transfer
The message of sustainability is, of course, a big public winner – and a very important in the grander scheme, as is the use of big driving names to keep engagement high. But there are other interesting elements at play, such as the technology, and the off-circuit race between brands to innovate.
 
According to Wired:
 
""Formula E is meant to utilise racing—long a rolling laboratory for automotive development, yielding advancements like antilock brakes, traction control, and dual-clutch transmissions—to help EV manufacturers and suppliers like BMW, Nissan, Audi, Panasonic, Mahindra, and Jaguar move their battery-powered products forward. Not just to showcase what electrics can do, but to make them better.""
 
These developments have led to numerous 'technology transfers', meaning brands developing safer, more powerful and longer-lasting electric vehicles, suitable for both the racing circuit, and the street, using the same technology.

Electric racing won't be stopping with Formula E, either. This July, at the legendary Goodwood Festival of Speed, Extreme E saw its world premier – a fully electric SUV race complete with special off-road Continental tires. This is a partnership, and a style of racing, that is set to really take off in the coming years. At least that's what the founder and CEO of Formula E, Alejandro Agag, believes:
 
“I’ve always been passionate about progressing electric vehicle technology and the impact that clean mobility solutions can have on the efforts to halt global climate change. I strongly believe that Extreme E can help make the world more sustainable faster, and we have a dream team to make this ambition a reality. Welcoming Continental Tires as a founding partner - and CBMM as niobium supplier - is a huge boost to Extreme E and shows the strong commercial appetite for this sustainable sport and entertainment concept.”.
 
There's no question that Formula E has helped drive both the electric technology itself, the 'big brand influence', and the publics' trust in it. But could the same thing be replicated with driverless tech too?

Try a little Roborace
As Goodwood festival played host to Extreme E, Roborace's DevBot 2.0 set its first official timed lap during the same event – completing the 1.16-mile course in 66.96 seconds, reaching top speeds of 100 miles/hour. It was the first time an official autonomous lap had been timed, making both motorsport and technology history.
 
July 2019 was a big month for autonomous racing. A few weeks after its jaw-dropping inaugural lap, the first autonomous race took place on the iconic Monteblanco race track. But some aficionados pointed out that, without a driver to root for, there wouldn't be much of a public draw.
 
Bryn Balcombe, Roborace's Chief Strategy Officer, still believes that autonomous racing will find its place in the racing world, with the lack of a driver compensated for in new and exciting ways.
 
""Motorsport has lots of different categories of racing, that all set different challenges, so be it Formula 1, be it Formula E or the World Endurance Championships, the tasks are all very different, and have different appeals. It has always created a diversity of competitions to drive technology in a particular way. What we're doing at Roborace is focusing on those new formats of competition, and those technology-driving challenges. We will still race on racetracks, but we will also have competitions in rural roads, on city streets and in other 'closed course' environments. After all, 'closed course' will bring full autonomy to life quickly, with new rules and regulations on the road.""

'Trust' is the word
Gaining public trust is essential for life-critical technology's market feasibility. In the case of electric vehicles, it was proving that the technology was capable of handling the same level of use as its fossil-fuel powered equivalent. In the case of autonomous ones, it's proving that you don't need a human at the wheel to be both safe and effective.
 
Much like Formula E, autonomous racing is bound to attract its sceptics, especially in its earliest phases. But, as the technology improves and public exposure to its capability increases, there's every chance it will soon gain the trust required to go mainstream.
""You have to experience the technology. We often talk about motors, but when you see two cars racing each other and one car crashes into another one, the public engage with it, and experience it. We want them to engage with the reasons why. That is what we should be doing with autonomous motorsport - giving the public that connection so they can ask: 'why did the software do that? That is unacceptable behaviour, I wouldn't want to see that on the roads'.""
 
In theory, if the technology can be proven to be safe whilst still managing to be edgy and exciting for the motorsport punter it could win public favour faster. After all, racing is still the most dangerous way to drive – a way of testing the fullest capabilities of the tech without business bias.
 
""This isn't a marketing environment. The track is a place where performance is objectively measured, and communicating the results to the public is essential. If you're going to build trust in the technology, you're going to have to be able to showcase: where is the technology now, what is it capable of and what are its limitations?""
 
Well, if it worked for electric, it could well work for autonomous. Only we'll be cheering on the engineers and programmers as the 'drivers', rather than the people who sit behind the wheel. Maybe, as this new way to race takes shape, we can answer the question: do we ultimately root for the cars, or the humans in control of them?
 
Perhaps we will be seeing a Formula AD in years to come. Keep your eyes on the grid.

Industry expert Christoph Schlegel explains which graduates will be in high demand for those jobs, how traditional companies can attract them, and what Dieter Zetsche’s cowboy hat has to do with that.

2025AD: Mr Schlegel, how is digitalization changing the car industry?
 
Christoph Schlegel: Let’s start with a symbolic transformation: In the past, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche made most of his public appearances at motor shows wearing suit and tie. This March, for the first time in his life, he went to the music and technology Festival South by Southwest (SXSW) in Texas. There he first wore sneakers and a baseball cap and later changed into leather boots and a cowboy hat. 
 
 

2025AD: In what way is this significant?
 
Schlegel: Zetsche wanted to send out two signals from Texas: First, Daimler has changed from a car manufacturer into a technology company that competes with Google and Tesla and provides access to all sorts of mobility. Zetsche’s second signal went to young graduates: “Look, the atmosphere at Daimler isn’t dominated by suit-wearing bosses who imposed a hierarchical structure of command-and-control. Instead Daimler is cooler with more space for creativity.”
 
 
2025AD: Why does Zetsche want to change Daimler’s image so radically?
 
Schlegel: Because he recognizes a fundamental shift: According to our calculation the monetary volume of the global market for advanced driver assistance features and autonomous driving will increase by 12-14% per year till 2025. Hardly any market in the world has such growth rates. Driver assistance will become a standard feature in most cars and we might soon be able to use the first robot-taxis.
 


2025AD: How can companies successfully compete in this market?
 
Schlegel: The crucial factor will be attracting the right talent. Car manufacturers like Daimler have already assigned 1000-1500 engineers to that technology and many suppliers have such teams as well. But their main difficulty will be finding more. For one thing, only few of these experts exist. And they are sought after by numerous employers, ranging from manufacturers, financial services firms to tech giants like Apple, Facebook or Microsoft. These companies pay high salaries and usually provide the kind of environment with space for independent thinking, flat hierarchies and free lunches.

2025AD: What kind of experts do car manufacturers and suppliers need?
 
Schlegel: So far they have employed many mechanical engineers who build hardware like motors and gearboxes. Plus, they use application engineers who adapt current products, like car brakes, to new model series. These people are still necessary, the demand for them will remain constant.
 
 
2025AD: And who will be needed to work on autonomous cars?
 
Schlegel: Different experts are necessary for each level of the so-called “ADAS/AD technology stack”: On the sensor-level physicists need to develop high-performance, yet affordable radars and optical lasers, so-called LiDARs, to measure the distance to objects for 3D scans of the environment. On the computing-level chip designers have to speed up central processing units while keeping energy consumption and costs low. The most innovative work however, is required on the final two levels: Software engineers need to write algorithms that use the data to build models of the environment. Computer vision and data fusion are critical components here. And finally, based on these models they have to create self-driving-rules so that cars can decide: “Do I stop or accelerate?” Thus cars will have to simulate human cognition and use machine learning and artificial intelligence. But that is a field that many companies are trying to get into.

2025AD: How can automotive suppliers win this war for talent?
 
Schlegel: First they have to strategically decide, how much they really want to change. By 2025 we expect the global market for autonomous driving to be not larger than 26 Billion U.S. Dollars. However, already today the annual revenue of big automotive suppliers is more than 40 Billion Euros, and often, these are diversified companies catering to many needs of the OEMs beyond driver assistance. These suppliers probably don’t want to transform entirely into software specialists and jeopardize their original business. Then their challenge is: How do you remain true to your core business, while creating an atmosphere with the features that attract graduates: flexible hierarchies, fast-paced work and innovative thinking.
 
 
2025AD: And what is the solution for that challenge?
 
Schlegel: There are two possible ways: Either spin-offs or acquisitions of start-ups that remain independent.
 
 
2025AD: What are the advantages of each of these models?
 
Schlegel: With a spin-off you take some of your own employees and intellectual property to start a separate business. This new business can then work like a start-up: quickly and creatively.
 
 
2025AD: And acquisitions?
 
Schlegel: If automotive suppliers feel that they need more external talent from the start they can purchase companies with their patents and their staff. Since they buy a company in order to hire, this form of acquiring a start-up is often referred to as acqui-hiring. However, the start-up should not be integrated into the parent company. It is better to keep it as a separate entity. In that way you maintain the start-up spirit and reputation to keep up the fast-paced work. Then you can keep attracting more talent.

From how we do business, to how we shop, travel or connect. Despite the far-reaching nature of autonomous driving, women are being under-represented in the discourse or being shoehorned into narrow content such as safety or vehicle aesthetics.

In this feature, 2025AD author Emily Saunders-Madden spoke to four women from around the globe to get their take on a driverless world, and what it would mean for them.
 
 
JESS (USA)
Jess is a multilingual stay-at-home mum living in Texas. Like many mothers, Jess doesn’t seem to focus much time on herself: “I’m very used to being both mum and dad! I get to do things for myself when the boys are at school.”
 
Jess says her daily transport challenge is getting to know her way around where she lives. She doesn’t want to rely on a satnav all the time. Like most drivers, traffic is a big source of frustration for her: ""depending on the time of day traffic can become quite busy. Not 'stand still', just slowly moving.”
 
When discussing her difficulties driving, Jess does admit to falling into one stereotype: “I sometimes struggle to remember to fill the tank up with petrol! After having a Tesla for four years – we would just plug it in to charge! I miss that, and the smooth, assisted drive of an electric car.""
 
As a Tesla fan, Jess has already considered what owning a fully driverless car would mean for her family: ""it would make long journeys a lot less stressful – it would free up more time to chat to our boys, watch movies together, play games and talk about what they wanted to do when we got to the destination.”
 
Jess confesses that, even with autopilot, she would worry over a loss of control with driverless vehicles. “I would have to put my hands on the steering wheel every five minutes.”
 
Despite this, she also acknowledges that one of the biggest benefits of a driverless society for her is that: “accidents should become none existent”.

NICOLE (GERMANY)
 Having worked at a software company for many years, Nicole has a strong grounding in tech developments. As the mother of two teenagers, living in the south of Germany, Nicole stresses the importance of running family life on a schedule.\
 
She drives a Renault Zoe – an electric car – and knows self-driving cars are largely still at the 'testing phase'. When asked if she would ever buy a driverless car she replied: “why not? It’s certainly more comfortable and less stressful!”
 
Nicole’s view of a driverless technology seems almost entirely positive. She describes a near future where robotic assistance and driverless technology are inevitable and explains that increased data monitoring and less privacy are already a reality. 
 
“For young people like my son, driverless features would be advantage as they would not have to worry about drinking a beer or two when they are out with friends, and when I get old it would help”.
 
In terms of other external benefits, she points out that driverless cars would bring more road safety, less traffic jams, and give drivers more time to do other things.
 
GEMMA (UK)
Gemma, a mother of two, works full time as a project manager in the advertising sector in the United Kingdom. Her awareness of driverless technology comes from over 20 years’ experience working with global automotive clients.
 
Gemma confesses: “I hate public transport – I like to be in control of my route and how I get there.” Unlike Nicole, Gemma’s view of the driverless car is bleak. She divulges that she “had a severe car accident 6 years ago, so I don’t think I have the confidence to trust a driverless car”. Such stories are common and feed into a fear of new automotive developments.
 
However, as we continue to discuss driverless cars, Gemma begins to see their appeal.
 
“I imagine being able to check in with friends on my phone, sitting in between my kids to stop them fighting on journeys, talking to them face-to-face. Maybe taking my dog on more journeys as she’s a nervous passenger - I could sit next to her and give her my attention.”
 
 
DONNA (FRANCE)
Donna is a hotelier and artist in central France. With her children fully grown, and owning her own business, she has the luxury of time to travel across Europe regularly.
 
Donna believes that technological advancements towards driverless cars are inevitable but is also apprehensive: “more information on driverless cars needs to be available. I’d like a choice of vehicle, and the subject to be 'dumbed down' a bit!”
 
Traffic is not a problem for Donna. She has entirely different concerns when driving:
“Winters can bring two metres of snow on the roads, spring electrical storms are common, and temperatures can reach 40-degree centigrade heat in the summer.” It’s these areas I hope driverless can help keep us safe on the road.
 
To Donna, driverless cars are still a distant reality, despite their benefits:
“I like the idea of enjoying the views on long trips, socialising with companions whilst on the move, and being less fatigued when I get somewhere, but the area I live in is very mountainous and rural. Technology doesn’t really work so well in disconnected areas like these.”

The bottom line
Industry-wide research tells us that women share the same concerns and hopes we all have over driverless vehicles. However, the public debate for them has over focused on safety and security. As publishers, we must ensure that we are open minded and address everything from financials, technological integrations, lifestyle, wellbeing and everything in-between.
 
We’d love to hear from you over the benefits that driverless could bring, so join the debate! What unique challenges and opportunities will driverless technology bring to your life?

A driverless solution may be a big goal, but thousands of small solutions will make it happen. Brands are tackling one innovation at a time to bring self-driven cars to the market.
 
In 2016, we wrote an article on JLR's attempts to develop systems that make driverless cars more 'human'. Today, we look at the JLR-specific developments that have taken place since then, to see how close they are to achieving their goals.
 
 
TAKE JAGUAR LAND ROVER
JLR is the UK’s largest automotive manufacturer. It's built around two iconic British car brands: the world's leading manufacturer of premium all-wheel-drive vehicles, Land Rover, and premier luxury sports saloon and sports car manufacturer, Jaguar. Both have taken big steps ahead in the race to autonomous driving over the last few years with several driverless key innovations.
 
In their own words, this innovation is continuous. This year alone, JLR will spend an estimated £4 billion on product creation and capital expenditure. This will help them ensure by 2020 that all new Jaguar Land Rover vehicles will offer the option of some level of electrification. It will also stand them in good stead for making a commercially viable driverless car.
 
Here are a few of the potential key ingredients of the final product.

JUST A HEADS UP
JLR has developed an intelligent system that projects the direction of travel onto the road ahead of self-driving vehicles, telling all other road users what it's going to do next.
 
The system, currently being trialled, will feature projections that will show when the vehicle is preparing to stop, pull away or turn. This trust-gaining move should help pedestrians and manual drivers feel safer when sharing the roads with driverless cars.
 
Pete Bennett, Future Mobility Research Manager at Jaguar Land Rover: ""The trials are about understanding how much information a self-driving vehicle should share with a pedestrian to gain their trust. Just like any new technology, humans have to learn to trust it, and when it comes to autonomous vehicles, pedestrians must have confidence they can cross the road safely. This pioneering research is forming the basis of ongoing development into how self-driving cars will interact with people in the future.”
 
 
NO MORE RED LIGHTS
According to the Telegraph, new research conducted by the comparison website confused.com, revealed British motorists who drive every day spend a fifth of their drive-time waiting at red lights. Solving what has been called the '150 year problem', JLR has developed new technology which uses Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2X) to connect cars to traffic lights. This is so drivers can avoid getting stuck at red, freeing up the flow of traffic, reducing both congestion and emissions in cities.
 
The technology, that is currently being trialled on a Jaguar F-Pace, works by communicating with the traffic light to determine how long the light will remain red. Then the Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) technology tells the driver the speed to drive to avoid getting stuck at red lights. Eventually, the GLOSA will communicate directly with the engine in driverless vehicles, ensuring it drives at an appropriate speed without having to slow down.
 
Applied or not, this system will improve congestion and reduce the emissions created from harsh braking or accelerating as drivers race to beat, or react late, to traffic lights. This ultimately means cleaner air, and less risk of incidents.

DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS
Motion sickness is a big problem for passengers. And, when every person in the car is a passenger, nausea could become a problem.
But pioneering JLR motion sickness research has identified techniques to reduce effects by at least 60%. First, a complex algorithm calculates individual ‘wellness scores’ for the driver and passengers. Then, vehicle dynamics and cabin settings will automatically adapt to individuals’ needs and work together to prevent sickness.

RING AROUND THE CITY
JLR plan to make self-driving vehicles a reality within 10 years. This may seem like a tight deadline, but the trials have been promising.
 
In October 2018, a Range Rover Sport completed the first ever public self-driving journey, with a lap of one of the UK’s most challenging road layouts, the Coventry Ring Road. This was a part of the £20 million government-funded UK Autodrive project. The Sport proved it could easily handle the famously plentiful and difficult junctions, slip roads and lane changes – all autonomously and within the 40mph speed limit.
 
And it doesn't stop there. JLR says they are still pursuing their 2016 goal of developing cars to acquire 'driver-like reactions' therefore becoming more 'human'. The system is expected to adapt to traffic situations in a manner comparable to the natural driving behaviours of humans. Its aim is to further foster trust in driverless technology, only this time by ensuring that autonomous cars will not behave like robots.
 
While ten years may feel very far away, progress is rapid. And, as JLR are proving, every successful trial brings us closer to a driverless future.
 
 
Speak up and join the debate! Do you think driverless cars will be ready for public consumption in ten years time? And do you think the public will trust them? We want to hear what you have to say.

There’s no need to speak to someone to make an order or arrange delivery for your new sofa or a box full of books or a pizza on a Friday night. So, what if the actual delivery could be made without human involvement too?
 
That’s exactly what we asked when we first looked into the world of driverless delivery back in 2019. Things have progressed since then and, with both food delivery and use of ecommerce rising in light of the ongoing pandemic, demand for more efficient delivery has grown too.
 
Could AVs make delivery greener?
 
While we’re ordering more items online and increasingly opting for faster delivery, we’re also becoming more and more concerned about the environmental impact of all that driving. In a traditional model, where vans are our primary delivery vehicles, that concern is founded in fact.
 
Versatile vans are essential to the way we live our lives, forming a critical element in construction, postal and courier services, emergency services, mobile workshops, passenger transport and more. But they come with an environmental cost. Since 1990, CO2 emissions from all vans on EU roads have risen by 58%, compared to just 20% in cars.
 
Though there are now regulations in place which mean all new vans need to be zero emissions by 2035, change is not happening rapidly. The average new van in 2019 emitted 159g of CO2 per kilometre. The comparable figure for 2020 is 154g – only half the rate of annual reductions needed to reach that 2035 target.
 
Making the switch to driverless delivery, then, may reduce the environmental impact of such vehicles by replacing a large number of them with AVs. As hybrid models seem to be the most popular in AV development for now, and greener hydrogen models are expected to be introduced from 2025, there is a strong case to be made for taking vans off the road in favour of self-driving delivery vehicles.

Are self-driving delivery vehicles already here?
 
Across the world, some delivery vehicles are already being replaced by self-driving robots. Since we last mentioned Nuro back in 2019, their offering of small, electric delivery robots has expanded. Now, you can order not just takeout, but groceries and pharmacy items to be delivered by the AVs and they’ve recently launched Dominos pizza delivery in Houston, Texas.
 
The tech is spreading beyond the US too. Since 2018, Starship has launched several fleets of wheeled robots in the UK, with 120 now operational in Milton Keynes, another 30 in Northampton and 60 more due to launch soon. Travelling on pavements, these compact machines are gaining traction with local audience though Henry Harris-Burland, director of marketing at Starship Technologies, maintains that acceptance isn’t easily won. “Even though our robots are doing only 4mph and are no taller than the average dog,” he explains, “people and communities can still feel threatened by them, so we have to prepare them.”
 
In Russia, the Yandex Rover, a small six-wheeled autonomous vehicle, has started delivering food in Moscow’s central business districts. And in China, ecommerce giant JD.com made its first delivery of medical aid via an autonomous vehicle last year. For both, the pandemic has been a driving force, accelerating the real-life applications of their tech and boosting public acceptance too.
 
That feeling, and the advancement of the delivery tech, is spreading quickly. In fact, as soon as 2023, Mobileye and Udelv aim to launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service running not just the small, single delivery robots we’ve seen elsewhere but large, van-like transporters. Between 2023 and 2028, they aim to get 35,000 on the road. Driverless delivery is ramping up.
 
Will there still be a place for people once delivery goes driverless?
 
Though we asked a similar question in 2019, it’s yet to be answered. The form of AVs currently being used driverless delivery do change the nature of the process. Now, customers must leave their property to meet the robot. With human delivery drivers, it’s the other way around.
Solving this ’50 foot problem’ is proving tricky as the last few steps between road and front door are incredibly difficult to navigate. Ford’s solution is to use two-legged robots alongside self-driving vehicles. In theory, these could overcome that last hurdle and at the moment it seems to be the most viable solution out there, but it remains an area for closer investigation.
 
Should we simplify the process and expect people to change? Will ‘delivery to door’ become a premium offering which still employs actual people? We can’t wait to see what happens next.

The fusion of internet-connected devices and our cars has therefore raised concern among many, and autonomous vehicles (AVs) which rely on wireless connections are often perceived as particularly vulnerable to attack.
 
We know that car hacking is not some far off threat but has already been done. In 2014 Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek made headlines when they hacked into a Jeep Cherokee and showed how they could take control of the car remotely. More recently, at a hacking contest in the US, Amat Cama and Richard Zhu used the Tesla Model 3 infotainment system as an ‘attack surface’ through which to take control of the car.
 
It seems that hacking will always pose a threat to automotive tech, but is it something we should be worried about? Is there a way to protect AVs from cybersecurity threats? We went to an expert ‘white hat’ hacker – also known as ethical hackers who test, rather than exploit, systems – to gain more insight into the world of hacking, and the impact it will have on our driverless future. Robert Leale, founder of the Car Hacking Village at Defcon, agreed to answer a few of our questions.
 
Will the cybersecurity threat to AVs grow as they become more complex?
The threat is similar to those of modern vehicles. Many are susceptible to ‘CAN Injection’ attacks, but most of these attacks require direct physical access to the vehicle network. This is, in some ways, easier when we think of fully autonomous vehicles that are used for ride-share applications.
 
In these applications, an implanted device could go undetected as a user may have unfettered access to the vehicle's network or other in-vehicle networks. So physical security is paramount. Many companies are considering adding Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to their vehicle networks to combat this. This a new concept in automotive, but has been around for decades in corporate computer networks.
 
In many ways, the complexity of driverless systems helps their security posture. The complexity makes each vehicle very unique from one to the next. This complexity de-incentivises attackers as creating an attack for one system doesn’t give you a large pool of vehicles which is useful for Ransomware-style attacks. However, targeted attacks are always possible.

How would you go about hacking into a driverless vehicle? Are there more opportunities to hack into a car with complex digital systems?
Hacking involves a lot of research. The first step is finding as much public documentation as possible, then getting access to a vehicle, and finally spending as much time poking at the vehicle's interfaces as possible.
 
However, we have to look at this from a return on investment (ROI) standpoint too. If my costs to buy or acquire the vehicle and spend a week or two with it were high, then I might not have reason to simply use this exploit for fun, but may have motivation to hold onto it. But if I wait too long a fix for the exploit may be available, thus negating my time and effort. As an attacker, I might not want to spend too much time trying to find an exploit only to have this exploit patched a week after I found it myself. Or, if I want, I can simply submit the bug to the manufacturer and receive the bounty.
 
In short, manufacturers are much more aware now of how these systems can be exploited and they understand best practices on how to work with the community to help them fix their issues.
 
How long would it take to hack a driverless vehicle?
Likely a long time for the research phase. It would require multiple people and a clear definition of the goals. There is the hacker whose goal might be to disable the system until a ransom is paid. This person would likely be defeated by over-the-air updates and up-to-date software running on the vehicle.
 
There is the hacker who hopes to understand how the system functions in order to reverse engineer it. They would likely only affect their own vehicle, not others. Then there is the hacker who might want to deny service on a fleet of vehicles with the goal of shorting the car company's stock. This attacker would likely need access to a command and control server inside the OEM’s IT infrastructure, so would need access to login credentials and perhaps physical access to the server. Each of the scenarios would take many people with multiple backgrounds all working together to achieve a challenging goal. Not impossible, but very challenging.
 
 
Hacking is perceived to be a big threat to the industry – there are plenty of people whose vision of a driverless future includes their cars being taken off course under someone else’s control. Is that realistic?
It would be very challenging. It would likely take a small group of people to attack driverless vehicles. That's not to say that these groups don't exist, but their motivation has not yet aligned. When it does, I anticipate that, likely state-sponsored, groups may have a go at hacking driverless vehicles and at first they will likely succeed in shutting down vehicles and preventing them starting. But when they do, the reaction by the industry will be swift, making future attacks much more challenging.
 
I believe there are a lot of manufacturers and suppliers working towards securing their systems and we'll see them continue. However, it is likely that the automotive cybersecurity industry is still under-funded, under-appreciated, and under-staffed, and until such an attack takes place, it’s difficult to see that changing.
 
Where there is new and developing technology, there will always be new threats to security. Working with experts in the field and developing a community which constantly supports fixes to any flaws in their systems will be vital to manufacturers. As long as OEMs dedicate time and resource to cybersecurity, by the time we see driverless cars of above level three become the norm, hacking into their systems should be too tough for most.

Who actually stops an autonomous vehicle on the run?

Life might be easier and safer with autonomous driving. Because with it comes new mobility concepts, not least, the so-called shared economy,breaking what is currently a clearly defined ownership culture. On top of that, while being driven (by the autonomous system), car passengers get the opportunity to use the travel time as they please. Whether that be working, surfing the Internet or even sleeping – fully autonomous vehicles will not be dependent on the driver. So much so that they could also be on their way without any passengers: a loaded truck, for instance, or an autonomous car dropping the passenger off at work then looking for a parking lot or the next passenger.
 
Indeed, with the advent of autonomous cars, many tasks will turn out to be easier than ever before: many…but not all. One area that faces a huge upheaval is law enforcement. How do the police pull over a driverless car? What does autonomous driving require from a legal point of view with regard to police officers and police inspections?
 
 


WHO CAN STOP AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES? AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOW?
Provided there are passengers onboard an autonomous vehicle, things remain relatively simple. They recognize the usual police signals such as flashing blue lights or sirens and then react accordingly. No matter under which jurisdiction, passengers must bring the autonomous vehicle to a standstill in such a case. This is possible without any problem. If the passenger on the other hand refuses to obey the command to stop, then they bear the brunt of any subsequent sanctions - just as the prior command to stop was directed at him/her.
 
Legally – as well as technically – it becomes interesting if and when the police want to stop an autonomous vehicle without any passengers on board, or one whose occupants are sleeping or indeed blind or deaf – not to mention small children, i.e. those who cannot react to the signals and instructions given by the police.

It is clear that autonomous vehicles must also be subject to and accessible for controls on the part of state authorities. But the nature of those controls may not be as we know them now. In the future, it will not be a case of controlling erratic driving or the consumption of alcohol but rather primarily the freight of autonomous vehicles. Even now, criminals use vehicles as weapons – like in the attack in Barcelona on 17th August 2017, Berlin at the Christmas fair on 19th December 2016 or Nice on 14th July 2016.
 
If not the car per se, then its cargo space or trunk could also be used to carry weapons, explosive material, smuggled goods or even trade in human beings.
 
If it is not permissible in law for police officers to bring an autonomous vehicle to a halt, then they constitute an area not regulated by law where police inspections are not possible.
 
 


SEIZING THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE
As long as there are passengers in an autonomous vehicle and you are appealing to the human senses, then optic and acoustic signals can be considered – because passengers can react to them.
 
Yet if such an attempt comes to nothing because passengers either don’t react or there are no passengers on board, then car-2-car communication between the police car and the autonomous vehicle in question could provide just the right solution. However, granting police cars the access to take over the steering and control any autonomous vehicle poses immense security risks – especially in times of heightened risk of hacker attacks. In such a concept, it is imaginable that cybercriminals could stop an autonomous vehicle rather easily, with grave consequences for both the passengers and the freight.
 
Implementing an authentication system would be technically safer. But would such a system be legally possible? This will be illustrated using German law.
 
 


THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW
As autonomous vehicles will also be connected, it is possible to bring the OEM into the police inspection process and to interconnect them as a check in the technical process. Under the German legal system, the OEM would act as an administrative assistant and only carry out acts without possessing any discretionary power. This prevents the risk of misuse.





      Will cybercriminals be able to remotely control an autonomous vehicle? (Photo: Adobe Stock /
    



Due to safety considerations, such a communication should be via satellite, not via mobile network as coverage cannot be guaranteed everywhere. Using such an authentication system would require the police authorities as well as the OEM to operate over a server. At first, every OEM would get an authentication key for every police vehicle on duty. If a police officer should want to stop a vehicle, an encrypted message would be sent to the server of the OEM by the police vehicle. The OEM would then compare that key with the original. Thereupon the OEM sends an inquiry to the server of the police authorities and requests the key used. If the police server confirms that it is a vehicle on duty, the OEM could then access the autonomous vehicle remotely, thus overriding the driving process and bringing the vehicle to a stop.
 
Such an authentication system would be a tough, real-time system fast enough for practical application.
 


THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY REARS ITS UGLY HEAD
Nevertheless, there is a remaining risk with regard to hacker attacks concerning each interface. Owners of autonomous vehicles are, legally speaking, not completely unprotected. If the safety mechanisms used by the police authority or the OEM fail, the damaged vehicle owner could claim for damages against either party - depending on the jurisdiction.
 
On a national level, according to German law, the authority may be held liable for damages as per § 839 BGB (German Civil Code) combined with Art. 34 S. 1 GG (German Constitution). However, this obviously requires that the authority actually is at fault.
 
However, on a state level, the federal state police law does not require any fault by the authority in order to consider a claim against them. To achieve the aim that owners of autonomous vehicles are protected across the whole country, all states must regulate a claim irrespective of where fault lies in such situations.
 
In the event of a breach of its responsibilities, the OEM could be claimed against for compensation according to the German Civil Code.
 
To summarize, while not without challenges, police inspections of autonomous vehicles are certainly technically as well as legally feasible in future.

We’ve all been there. It’s 9pm on a Friday night. You’ve just put on your comfiest pyjamas... only to discover there’s no food in the house. Well, no food that you have the energy to make into a meal after a long working week. 
» Hier findest du diesen Artikel in deutscher Sprache. «
You do the sensible thing and order a takeaway. A pizza, maybe. You don’t even need to talk to the person taking the order, it’s all done via an app. But you will still need to receive your dinner once it has been prepared - and that requires human input. A person to hand your pizza to you. 
At least, it does right now in most parts of the world. But that’s showing signs of changing and there are a few places putting driverless deliveries into practice. Today, we look at what that could mean for the delivery vehicles, for their drivers and for us.  







            The unsung heroes of the vehicular world (Photo: unsplash)
          





Stop thinking about pizza for a moment and start thinking about the people and the technology that delivers them. Have you ever thought about vans? Sure, many of us have daydreamed about ditching the 9-5 grind in favour of an old school VW campervan, the open road and no real place to be. But how much thought do we give to 'light commercial vehicles' and their drivers?  
It turns out we should probably be paying more attention to the vans in our life than we have been. They are the unsung heroes of the vehicular world and are a much bigger deal for our day-to-day lives than we may realise. They are also about to undergo an autonomous revolution, which could completely change the way we see, drive and use them.  
 
 
The importance of delivering driverless 
According to the ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers Association), versatile vans are essential to the way we live our lives, forming a critical element in construction, postal and courier services, emergency services, mobile workshops, passenger transport and many other things. They are largely used by small to medium sized businesses – or SMEs – and are therefore essential to the economy. The world, as we know it, simply couldn't work like it does without them.  
However, in 2016, 96 per cent of them were diesel, with the average emissions of each measured at 163.8g CO2/km. This is not sustainable. Yet vans will always be essential, especially for deliveries. Clearly, something has to change. First, they will become electrified, then, they will become autonomous. Globally. 
 
Delivering driverless: USA
 







            photo: nuro.ai
          





There have already been big leaps in the field of driverless deliveries, especially in America. The Silicon Valley company Nuro has started a ‘robo-delivery service’ in partnership with grocer Kroger Co in Scottsdale, Arizona, with plans to roll it out to Houston later this year. Nuro has also partnered with Dominos, with tiny self-driving pizza delivery vans ""with no space for a human operator"" already taking to the streets of Houston. Customers receive a one-time PIN when they order, which allows them to access their pizza when it arrives - although this does involve them leaving their home – albeit – briefly to collect the pizza on the street, which some would prefer to avoid.
H-E-B, the largest grocer in Texas, has announced it will be partnering with Udlev to roll out its own driverless delivery programme later this year. The specially-designed vehicles will be fitted with temperature-controlled compartments for fresh, frozen and dry food and will be capable of the same speeds as regular delivery vans. 
In terms of grander scale deliveries, the retail conglomerate Walmart has partnered with the technology company Gatik ""in the hopes of moving customer orders from its supercentre in Rogers, Arkansas down a two-mile stretch of road in Bentonville to one of two nearby stores"". Gatik has also modified three Ford Transit vans for similar use in California. These are currently in operation seven days a week; although they currently feature human safety drivers, too. 
Meanwhile, in China
There isn’t just movement in the US. Neolix, a Chinese start-up, recently began full-scale production of affordable self-driving delivery vehicles, which it has been testing quietly on Chinese campuses for several months. 
In fact, the testing phase has been and gone. Dubbed a success, full-scale production of the vehicles has begun and soon they will be moved off campus and into the real world to deliver pizzas, and many other things, to people in major Chinese cities before the year is out. They may well even get there before the US does. 
So far, it's looking as though driverless delivery vehicles will be commonplace before domestic driverless vehicles will. This is no surprise, as they will be largely transporting 'goods' as opposed to people. And while the possibilities of this are naturally exciting, it does beg the question: what happens to the human driver? 
The 50 foot solution 







            photo: istock
          





Whenever autonomy is discussed, the question of what will happen to the drivers closely follows. There is a global concern about autonomy resulting in unemployment en masse.  
But this is where the importance of the 'human touch' in delivery driving comes in. While a redesigned delivery vehicle could well automate the A-B element of bringing the item from the depot to its destination, there's still the need to get it to the door and often into the hands, of the customer.  is something even the most advanced autonomous technology The Ford Motor Co has hypothesised that eventually a two-legged robot could take over, should we trust a ronot to access our homes, but the global delivery company UPS has other ideas. 
Imogen Pierce, the head of communications at the van-centric technology company Arrival, who are partnered with UPS, calls this ""the 50-foot solution"". It grapples with the notion that the last 50 feet, between the vehicle door and the customer door, is the last thing to solve. And it needs a human to do it. Building entry, after all, is rarely straightforward and many deliveries require someone to receive them. 
There's every possibility that humans will still be necessary in the courier world, even if they aren’t driving the vehicles. Of course, if their jobs are safe, this will mean a drastically changing role for the drivers themselves: 
“For some customers, the person delivering may be the only person they see that day. We need to be mindful of not making human contact a luxury but making it an easier thing to get. Autonomy should help with that.”  
Solve the 50-foot problem, solve the problem of the human’s place in an autonomous world. At least, that’s the theory. But hey, these are the questions that need to be asked and answered. Over and over again, in every language.  
Until we get there, we suggest you sit back and enjoy your pizza. 
 
Join the debate! Will vanlife ever reliably be the same again once autonomy takes hold – and will the delivery drivers find their place within it?

In keeping with this vision, a fully driverless taxi debuted on the streets of Tokyo last year and Toyota have revealed they aim to have their driverless e-Palette taxi / minibus transporting VIPs on specially designed routes across the city.

Both Tokyo and Japan on the whole are working hard to get driverless vehicles on the road, earning them 11th place on KPMG’s Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index. But who else is up there with them? We took a look at the countries who have placed autonomous driving high on the priority list, with a precious place on the ‘Autonomous Olympics’ podium.

Bronze: Norway
Vast, beautiful and with some of the best driving roads in the world, Norway wouldn’t immediately catch the eyes of car manufacturers; after all, there are only around 4 million people in the entire country and around 2.7 million vehicles. However, digging deeper into the figures shows a nation of car owners who are ready for change.
 
At the beginning of 2019, there were 195,351 electric cars in Norway, with a staggering 60% of car sales in 2018 being made up by battery-powered vehicles. Norway’s commitment to moving away from fossil fuels goes all the way from the highest levels of government right into households, with the government offering benefits like tax exemptions, free parking and free charging points to tempt consumers to save money and the environment by going electric.
 
This willingness to adapt to a new way of doing things is one big reason why Norway makes the top three, but the fact that driverless transport already exists in the capital Oslo is another huge tick in the box. In April this year, driverless buses began to operate in Oslo city centre. This means that autonomous driving has already been accepted and ratified on a local government level, making it easier to sell to decision-makers higher up the chain – as long as it is a success.
 
The final factor is that Norway’s road infrastructure is actually pretty good. Even the most remote roads feature safety barriers and markings that are regularly re-painted, making it a lot easier for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely.

Silver: Singapore
If you’ve ever visited Singapore, you’ll know just how restrictive it is to own a car. The city takes a hard line when it comes to ownership, taxations, tolls and congestion charges in order to keep the busier parts of the city-nation safer less polluted. It seems that driverless cars are now the preferred method for cutting that restricted number of vehicles to an even smaller figure.
 
Singapore is already well ahead of the competition too; driverless cars have been allowed to operate since 2017 and the government has already started trialling driverless buses. But the biggest reason for their place on the podium is the government’s commitment to autonomous vehicles.
 
In February 2017, Singapore’s Ministry of Transport signed off on full autonomous vehicle testing on public roads, meaning that driverless vehicles could be developed in real-world conditions. But even that huge step may not have been needed.
 
In partnership with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore created the world’s first mega-scale autonomous vehicle test bed – in the form of an entire town.
 
Despite these big steps towards automation, there are a few reasons why Singapore just misses out on the top spot. As mentioned, tough restrictions on vehicle imports and high car ownership taxes, which make up almost 4% of tax revenue collected in the entire nation, mean that actually getting driverless vehicles into the hands of consumers is still tough. There’s also fact that the oil-rich nation is proving slower to adapt to alternative technologies, with electric vehicles only making up only around 4% of the 600,000 private vehicles registered in Singapore.

Gold: The Netherlands
Just pipping Singapore to the stop spot is the Netherlands, topping the 2019 Autonomous Vehicle Readiness study. The Netherlands gained high scores in policy & legislation, technology & innovation, infrastructure and consumer acceptance, showing that Dutch politics and culture are ready for driverless vehicles on the whole. In March, the Dutch government announced a new legal framework for driverless vehicles, including a type of ‘driving license’ awarded to self-driving cars. Yes, you read that right – a license for the vehicle, not the owner.
 
On top of that, there’s also the army of self-driving trucks that will transport mainly flowers to ports and neighbouring countries. This ‘platoon’ of fully self-driving heavy goods vehicles uses one lead truck driven by a human, with several autonomous trucks following behind and braking, changing direction or accelerating in line with the vehicle in front, all thanks to smart AI. Journeys along the ‘tulip corridors’ into Belgium and Germany will take place at night in line with current delivery schedules and when the roads are quieter, with 5G enabled smart traffic lights ensuring the autonomous road trains don’t get split up.
 
One challenge that faces the Netherlands is the prevalence of bicycles on Dutch roads, especially in urban areas. Dealing with pedestrians and other vehicles is tough enough for AI, but smaller bicycles that often travel faster than cars in Dutch cities pose a whole new safety issue. To combat this, the focus is currently on motorways and avenues that feature cycle lanes completely separate from the driving surface, but it will be interesting to see if bikes and driverless vehicles can one day share roads without as many safety concerns.
 
How does your country rank in the KPMG report? Do you live in the Netherlands, Singapore or Norway and agree with the rankings? Join the debate and let us know what you think about sharing the road with driverless vehicles.

            photo: https://what3words.com
          





To understand what3words and the changes it brings to navigation – and to driverless cars – we must first explore how GPS works and why postal addresses have had their day. We did this by speaking to Giles Rhys Jones, the Chief Marketing Officer at what3words, to get his expert perspective on how traditional navigation methods and technology need to be left behind.
 
How does GPS work?
GPS is a system of navigation satellites that are circling Earth and constantly sending out signals. A receiver in your phone, car or device listens for these signals and, once received, it figures out your location by calculating the distance from the satellites.
 
The location itself is represented as GPS coordinates that, up until recently, have been exclusively determined by postal addresses that typically navigate to the centre of the building in question. In fact, over 70% of addresses surveyed didn't lead to their main door – and therefore found that deliveries, services and visitors struggled to find them.
 
The problem(s) with postal navigation
Postal addresses have served their purpose to a point – but they are limited, and don't cover everywhere you could possibly want to drive to. Parks, sports fields, beaches, car parking spaces, for example, are all off-limit for navigation systems. The best anyone can do is find the closest postal address and navigate using a traditional map from there – or perhaps drop a 'pin' to where they think they must drive to.
 
But urban-bias isn't the only problem with postal-navigation. Inaccuracy is inherent, due to the fact the addresses themselves are not unique. There are 14 Church Roads in London, for example, and 632 Juarez Streets in Mexico City. Duplications like this can lead to some big problems for the users. Take the unfortunate American tourist, for example, who typed 'Laugarvegur' instead of 'Laugavegur' and ended up on a six-hour detour in Iceland.
 
There's also serious incompatibility with voice recognition, which is an increasingly essential element of modern driving. Voice systems will often struggle to pull up the correct destination due to accents, and many addresses include homophones. Take Lorne Road and Lawn Road in London, for example. The navigation system would 'hear' the same thing in any accent, despite the roads being a 15-minute drive apart. 
 
""Postal addresses were designed to sort mail hundreds of years ago, for which they do a fantastic job, but they weren’t designed for an increasingly mobile population or the expanding eCommerce market.""







            photo: www.what3words.com
          





The what3words difference
 works dividing the world in its entirety – into 3m x 3m grid squares and giving each one a unique 'three word identifier' to take the place of an address. One that could take you directly to your required entrance or parking space, rather than the 'centre' of the nearest building. The what3words algorithm essentially converts GPS coordinates into words. So, instead of typing, or saying: “51.520847, -0.19552100” you could simply say: “filled count soap”.
 
It can be used for all sorts of things, from directing a car to having a pizza delivered to a park bench, to locating where your friends have camped during a hike. There has already been some significant traction in its use in emergency services, where an injured person has been able to tell paramedics exactly where they are – especially useful when the postal address is unknown. Now, over 60% of emergency services in the UK use it, with that number set to increase.
 
The long-term goal is to be the new standard for global addresses. That way:
 
""Everyone in the world - in cities, on remote islands or even ger tents on the Mongolian plains - has a simple and reliable address they can use whenever they need it. We want everyone to use their three-word address anywhere where you'd enter a traditional address. That could be in eCommerce checkout pages, food delivery apps, ride hailing apps, car sat navs and also mapping apps."" Giles Rhys Jones, Chief Marketing Officer.







            photo: www.what3words.com
          





The driverless benefits
The business and personal benefits to more accurate and user-friendly location identification in general is huge – but what of the driverless impact? Well, according to the minds behind w3w:
 
""[This] is a perfect solution for drone deliveries and autonomous vehicles. A street address is far too broad an area for a drone to know where to land, and an autonomous vehicle will need an incredibly precise location to know where to end its journey, far more so than a street address allows.""
 
And as for its integration with driverless vehicles? Well, that has already begun:
 
""[Our] technology has now been built into #AccessibleOlli, allowing passengers to simply say three words to navigate to any 3m x 3m square in the world. Olli is a self-driving shuttle built by Local Motors and enhanced by IBM Watson. The project is finding ways for people with disabilities or impaired mobility to benefit from the autonomous vehicles of the future."" Giles Rhys Jones, Chief Marketing Officer.
 
If you consider the fact that driverless cars only really work when door-to-door collections and drop-offs are possible too, what3words could well be the latest missing piece in the autonomous driving puzzle.
 
For anyone who's interested in trying out what3words for themselves, there's a free app available on the app store. It can even work offline. All you need is a GPS location, and it will tell you exactly where you are and exactly where you need to be.
Do you think this method of navigation will take off? If not, why? Join the debate, and make your voice heard.

""I have two boys, 11 and 7-years-old, I do believe that my 7-year-old may never have to drive. Ever."" 
 
Autonomous vehicles are coming. There's no question of that. The technology already exists, the testing is in full swing, and the regulation and supporting infrastructure are slowly clicking into place around it. There are children alive today who may well never have to learn to drive, which is an exciting prospect. But there are still many unanswered questions about how driverless will change the world – including how some of the more obscure risks – such as how socioeconomic accessibility will be addressed. Something which could potentially be solved by a shift away from the traditional transport business model.
 
Ex-investment banker Shivas Kumar understands risk better than most. With decades of professional experience firmly rooted in the tech industry, and a new post as the EVP of the fleet management software company Ridecell, he understands the deeper impact of disruptive tech. He is in the perfect position to watch the driverless revolution unfold, and to see the real-time effects. He also has a unique perspective on how some of the negative impacts may be countered, and theories about how the big automotive brands involved will not only survive – but thrive.







            photo: ridecell.com
          





Driverless socioeconomics 
 Autonomous technology is expensive to purchase, maintain and repair, which means ownership will be out of reach for many. But looking at the benefits in terms of immediate financial impact may be a little short-sighted.
 
""Think about people who are affected by distance, who cannot afford to travel, to gain necessary skills, expertise or even going to work. It'll be possible for many to tap those, because of due to economies of scale, the prices of autonomous mobility will come down.







            photo: istock.com
          





Accessibility is indeed important, which could mean a greater level of ""social mobility"" for all, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Of course, location also comes into play. But driverless tech could help solve that age-old conundrum too, in a very unexpected way:
 
""Another significant implication to me is real estate. Think about California – which is pretty expensive. People have to live closer to work and the commercial offices in the Bay Area, like Palo Alto, or in the city, and all of those places are very expensive. But with autonomous vehicles you could have a city job, but live in the more suburban areas and in bigger places, increasing your standard of living by getting a lot more for your money.""
 
But, as there  are currently so many unknowns regarding the cost of driverless cars to operate and use on the day-to-day, do we really know if there will be a big enough universal consumer cost saving?
 
""Yes, it's really expensive now. But over time the prices will come down. Autonomy will unlock transportation to lower-income families because now they can afford to ride a car instead of buses.""
 
How will public transport be affected by autonomous vehicles?
Should autonomy take off to the extent the experts predict, the transport industry as a whole could be transformed. It is widely believed could even be that autonomous vehicles will eventually replace public transport altogether – but is that what Shiva believes?
 
""There will be a shift, yes. Although it won't be a complete replacement. You might use trains for the long distances, and then the cars will be used for the short to mid distances once you've alighted.""
 
Of course, there are additional environmental concerns when it comes to using more vehicles to transport less people, but many believe that autonomous vehicles will be almost exclusively electric.
 
""Trains move people in their masses, whereas cars can only transport two to four people at a time. Yes, that is a downside to it, but as you move from a combustion engine to what is likely to be an electric one in autonomous vehicles, the impact promises to be diminished from an environmental perspective.""







            photo: ridecell.com
          





The rise of driverless fleets
It's clear that if driverless cars are operated under the same circumstances as traditional cars have been, there might be a big problem in terms of cost, accessibility, and environmental impact. But the economy has long been slipping to a subscription-based model, and fleet-based transport could well solve all of these problems, and more. In fact, it could ultimately lead to more choice for the consumer, regardless of their socioeconomic status – just look at what happened with Spotify and Netflix.
 
""As the economy goes from ownership to subscription model, there will be a rise of the driverless fleets. There will be a demand for all sorts of transport, for all sorts of reasons, and it depends on the day and the time, whether it is raining, shining or snowing. I think more transportation will exist and it will exist in an equal system where the consumer can make their own choice of vehicles  rather than have it made for them as they do with the existing public transport model.""
 
Right now there are approximately a million non-autonomous fleet vehicles operating in the world – largely in the US and Europe. Shiva predicts that, in the next 20 years, over half of the vehicles in the world will be fleet, whether they need drivers or not, and they are all more than likely to be electric too. But how could the big-name automotive brands fit into this changing landscape if their models have, up until this point, been based almost exclusively around ownership?







            photo: istock.com
          





Big brand survival 
Let's say that Shiva is correct and, by 2040, fleets will dominate the roads. Maybe they will be autonomous too, if his ""eight to ten year"" timeline to autonomy is to be believed. Will the same big automotive players be in the game, or will they have been replaced by the tech start ups we are only just starting to hear about today?
 
To know the answer, we have to look at the brands which are already operating with a fleet mindset.
 
""Uber and Lyft will continue to gain strength and own the consumer experience, hence they will start dictating the type of cars in fleets, the type of insurance, the type of charging, maintenance and even cleaning. It will all come from them, as opposed to the consumer.""
 
Assuming that the original equipment manufacturers, or OEMS, take to this new twist in demographic well, there may be ample opportunity for an entirely new way to do business.
 
""The OEMs who will survive and thrive are the ones who will continue to innovate and transform. The German car industry have been at the forefront. So far, we've seen VW, Daimler and BMW all coming up with their own mobility services, with Daimler and BMW combining on the services side too. I think that open-mindedness of acquisitions, innovative culture and manufacturing muscle will lead to a bright business future. Those who innovate will survive.""
 
A move away from ownership to subscription worked for the music and movie world – but will it work for the auto world too? Well, if autonomy is wants to realise its full potential of benefits I guess it’s going to reap the full roster of the benefits that it promises, including: less congestion, less pollution, more accessibility – it might well have to.

Here we take a look at a few of the more unexpected places which are taking on the automated driving (AD) challenge. 
 
Driverless tech is making huge strides all over the world, but making a world in which this new method of transport is ready for the road is about more than the vehicles themselves. Infrastructure, legislature and public acceptance all have huge roles to play. We’ve looked before at a few of the cities at the forefront of AD, but things have changed since then. Some projects have been slow to get off the ground, Tokyo never saw the Olympics for which self-driving vehicles were promised, and so we thought it was time to re-assess. Which cities are now preparing for a driverless future?
 
 
Trondheim, Norway
All aboard the driverless bus! Known as Norway’s capital of technology, it is perhaps not surprising that the first European on-demand self-driving bus is, this year, being piloted in Trondheim. Ordered via an app, the self-driving bus can carry up to six passengers and presents many possibilities for the future. Might the bus be a blueprint for the future of public transport? Is an on-demand service going to be key to connecting residential areas, and those not usually served by traditional public transport, to the cities? The answer may well lie in Trondheim.

Barcelona, Spain
Preparing for a driverless future isn’t just about the cars. In Barcelona, the Autonomous Ready Spain project is prioritising infrastructure in order to make sure that when autonomous vehicles (AVs) are ready, Spanish roads will be too. In its pilot project, a fleet of 400 vehicles have covered 45,000 kilometres a day, collecting information and mapping the roads with precision. This provides valuable data for both city planning and virtual AV testing, while showing how sectors can collaborate efficiently on the road to a driverless future.
 
 
Bristol, UK
It may not be the first city which springs to mind when considering the development of driverless tech in the UK, but Bristol is doing something different with the driverless pods now on the road at its airport. Designed to ferry passengers from car parks to terminals, the Capri project is testing truly driverless vehicles on roads shared with pedestrians, cyclists and other motorists. The airport is an ideal test bed and, with no engineer in place ready to take the wheel should anything go wrong, the project marks a real step forward in testing.

Dubai, UAE
Self-driving taxis have been on the road in Dubai for a little while now, but the city has bigger ambitions when it comes to driverless tech. Those ambitions are becoming possible through legislation as the city has now passed laws which make it easier for self-driving vehicles to be tested on public roads. The Dubai Smart Mobility Strategy is aiming high too – by 2030 lawmakers aim to ensure that a quarter of journeys in the city are made in AVs!

Las Vegas, USA
A lot has been said about Waymo’s self-driving taxi service in Phoenix, but it’s not the only place you can order a ride without a driver. In Las Vegas, Lyft has logged 50,000 trips in its autonomous vehicles and, crucially, you don’t have to be an approved or selected user to go driverless – order a Lyft and an AV may turn up. That has the potential to do wonders for public perception in Vegas and beyond.
 
 
Zalaegerszeg, Hungary
What comes after creating an AV? Testing, of course! Zalaegerszeg, in Hungary, is setting itself up as the perfect place to do just that. ZalaZone, an impressive track which includes elements of every imaginable obstacle on the road, has been positioned as the ideal testing ground for self-driving vehicles. “The future around us has begun,” it was stated at the opening ceremony. “It is called the digital economy, or Industry 4.0 and this project is the first ticket we have bought for the journey into that future.”
 
 
New York, USA
Driverless cars may not be an unexpected feature of New York, but a recently approved project to put autonomous buses to the test in the Lincoln Tunnel is certainly novel. Connecting New York and New Jersey, the tunnel is a lifeline for commuters but has become increasingly busy since it opened in 1971. Self-driving buses which are able to travel closer together, and more efficiently than human-controlled ones, could increase capacity during the morning rush hour by an impressive 30%. Could autonomy be the key to making sure reliable mass transit is an option into the future?

As all our lives become increasingly busy, autonomous vehicles are starting to look like the perfect solution for many. Less time carrying out errands, more time to use how you like while travelling and less stress on the road are all possible outcomes of the tech. But to reap the benefits, we have to be prepared for AVs to become a regular part of how we get around.
 
With that in mind , we asked two New Jersey mums what they think of driverless technology, how AVs might change their lives and whether they’re ready to accept them. As parents are generally incredibly busy people – juggling work, childcare and all the errands which come with both – they’re perfectly placed to benefit from the time-saving tech, but we know that entrusting your children to anyone, or anything, is a particularly sensitive issue. Emma*, a mum of two, and May, a mum of three, share their thoughts below.
 
What do you already know about driverless vehicles?
 
May: I know very little about them right now. I know that there are a few that have been tested successfully, yet recall an incident that caused a fatal crash.
Emma: Not very much. Just that there will be improved technology available that will allow for driverless vehicles. Unfortunately, the media in the US has showcased examples wherein there have been accidents with driverless vehicles – I remember the stories of one that Uber was experimenting with  – casting a doubt of safety.  
 
Are there driverless vehicles in your area? How do you think they’ll arrive – as personally owned vehicles, rented like an Uber, or as a form of public transport?
 
E: No there aren’t any where I live yet, that I’m aware of, and if it is then it is very limited. But, if the technology is advanced and there is a way to 100% ensure there will be no accidents then yes I can see utility for all these areas.  
M: I haven’t seen any in my area either, nor have I ever ridden in one, but I imagine they’ll arrive as an on demand service like an Uber, or more broadly used as public transportation.

Would you trust an autonomous vehicle to keep your children safe?
 
E: No, for me there have been too many publicized accidents already with the very limited use of these vehicles. It will be difficult as a mother with small children to ever trust this technology because if something were to happen, I would never forgive myself. If it’s you driving, you can blame yourself, but when you delegate this responsibility to a technology and something bad happens, it is a decision and guilt you cannot overcome. With your kids, it’s not worth taking any chances. As a mother there is a sense of peace when you drop them off to their destination and drive away. There is a feeling of knowing they are safely there and will be there when I pick them up. I just wouldn’t have that with this technology and any trade off in convenience is not worth it for me.
M: I agree, I wouldn’t trust them yet. It would take years of broad testing, similar to my expectations for new medicine, to ensure its safety first. The benefits of convenience would have to outweigh the potential safety risks. If everyone was in a self-driving car, perhaps it would be safer, but there are too many random behaviors by ‘live’ drivers that make me concerned that an AV would not know how to safety respond. 
 

Trusting driverless tech can be a challenge when the dangers associated with them are unlike anything we’ve experienced on the road so far. Find out more about the threat of hacking as we ask ‘Will driverless cars be safe from cyber-attacks?’

 
What would be the biggest advantage of self-driving cars for you personally?
 
M: For me, the biggest advantage is service and getting back time to do other things rather than driving. I spend a lot of time driving my kids places – school, friends, shopping – so having an AV would help to facilitate these tasks. On the flip side, while it would give me back some time, I would miss some of the quality one-on-one time I have when driving my kids places. 
E: Yes, it would free up time to do other things, avoid putting mileage on our cars, reduce our frequency of getting gasoline, and keep our cars newer for longer. It could allow a working mother to do things she would have difficulty managing in the morning like exercise, mindfulness, getting lunches together too.

What would you do with that extra free time?
 
E: Likely worry about whether the driverless vehicle is in a crash or hit a pedestrian! I would try to get my daily duties done if the worries had subsided. A great use for the driverless car is to run errands like dropping this at the post office, grocery shopping, etc.
M: Yikes, probably work more. Hopefully exercise outdoors more. There is always something to do, but at least driving would not be on the list!
 
What sort of features would you like to see in your driverless car? 
 
E: Safety features that ensure the car cannot crash into anyone or anything. The ability to monitor the car remotely and check things like speed and location. If you have small children – typically there are safety locks on car doors for them – the doors of the car would need to automatically open so they can get out of the car and get to their destination.  
M: Outside of day to day use, I would consider longer trips in the AV – trips that I typically reserve only for flights – so therefore I would like to have features such as ergonomically enhanced chairs that enable me to comfortably sit and sleep, amenities for food and beverages and entertainment like on a first-class flight. I would want to make sure that the driverless car was always at least two to three car lengths away from others for safety and would rather travel on highways where trucks were not allowed too. 
 
In the end it is trust which is the main obstacle for both Emma and May. Of all the stumbling blocks in the way of mass acceptance of autonomous vehicles – including legal issues, technical advancement, safety and more – trust is key. Without it, users simply will not choose to use the technology and so widespread acceptance will be delayed. In Emma and May’s responses we can see how just one fatal accident can harm trust for years. Though the fatal Uber accident happened in 2018, the damage on public perception remains. 
 
Yet we know that accidents, even fatal ones, are part of technological advancement and have been overcome in previous developments. Trust is often slow to develop with new technology, yet when something new proves useful, acceptance soon follows. Many were afraid of rail travel at the start of the 19th century, fearing travel at speeds of 30mph could do real harm, yet trains soon became one of the greatest markers of progress. The same is true for automation – just think of all the many and varied processes we entrust to robots today. The same will be true of autonomous vehicles.

Conditions like fog, rain and snow can make it impossible for driverless cars to detect lane dividers and road signs and could even obscure their own cameras. Though more data is being collected in a range of conditions, there’s no denying that fair weather is a default for testing in the industry.
 
Where driverless cars have been put to the test in snow, weaknesses have been discovered. For example, when Krysztof Czarnecki tested a self-driving car in Canada using data gathered in Germany, he found he had to correct its movements several times owing to the volume of snow on the road – something that just wasn’t present in the data. Make no mistake, humans are worse drivers in these conditions too – accidents actually increase by 20% in the winter months. But public desire to see AVs as a safer alternative to human drivers means they need to do better, not merely equal our efforts to navigate through adverse weather.
 
As Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, which regularly works with autonomous driving companies, says, “It’s a very noticeable blind spot. Deploying autonomous vehicles in bad conditions is not really tackled, or talked about.” Yet, for some vehicles, heavy snow could be considered a ‘normal’ driving condition and even here autonomous technology is making inroads.

Are autonomous snow ploughs in operation right now?
 
Snow ploughs are perhaps the ultimate bad weather vehicles, designed to work in the most difficult conditions, and already autonomous versions are being tested. Designed to work as part of a fleet which could clear deep snow in record time, Daimler’s first autonomous snow plough was tested back in 2018 to great success. Yeti Snow Technology soon followed with a system aimed at clearing snow from airport runways and highways. Tested for the first time at a snowy airport north of Oslo, the snow ploughs are impressive vehicles – 20 metres long, 5.5 metres wide and able to clear an area of 357,500 square metres (approx. 50 football fields) in just one hour.
 
Their ability to tackle tricky conditions all comes down to design and forward-thinking. Snow, and heavy snow at that, is accounted for from the very earliest stages of design in these vehicles – a consideration that is perhaps not afforded to other autonomous vehicles we have seen thus far. Yet these large-scale snow ploughs use much of the same technology as the zippy cars self-driving around places like California.
 

You want to know more about how this data could improve autonomous cars and their ability to do a better job at driving in the darkness than humans? Read our article ""Prince of Darkness: Autonomous vehicles at night"".

 
 
How do driverless vehicles work in the snow?
 
GPS perhaps becomes more important in these designs as, despite all efforts, snow still has the ability to block visual cues for cameras and even make sensors less accurate. The Yetis, for example, follow pre-programmed routes to minimise the potential of being guided off course. Though these routes can be adapted and the vehicles are connected to remote human safety drivers, the lack of additional cameras and sensors means they have less autonomy than other AVs.
 
However, other snow-clearing vehicles already include a wider range of sensors. In the US, Winnipeg Richardson International Airport is now home to an autonomous snow plough, nicknamed Otto, which uses a combination of GPS and LIDAR. Shawn Schaerer of Northstar Robotics explains, “We use GPS to guide the vehicle up and down the paths we want to maintain and we use sensors like LIDAR and radar to sense around it. If there’s something in front of it, it stops.”
 
This is an interesting point as, due to the very nature of the work these vehicles are designed to carry out, if weather conditions become too difficult to navigate, they can simply stop. An autonomous car driving on potentially busy roads, however, cannot. This is exactly why weather testing for autonomous vehicles remains such a hot issue as the fail safes (i.e. stopping) which protect autonomous snow ploughs, do not work for more commercial forms of transport.
 
However, testing of AVs is beginning to consider weather more prominently. Where most testing was once carried out in bright, dry conditions, companies like Ford are now going out of their way to ensure driverless cars see rain, snow, fog and greyer skies on test runs. There is a way to go but making weather a core consideration of testing and development is certainly a step in the right direction.

How might AVs prove useful in adverse weather?
 
Operating in all weather conditions may be a challenge for autonomous tech and the fact these snow ploughs are designed to stop when conditions become too dangerous suggests that the formula is yet to be perfected. To see the rollout of autonomous features in vehicles which must carry on through all weathers, significant testing and the development of sensor systems which can do their job in even the roughest weather is needed. But the success of driverless snow ploughs shows we are moving forward.
 
Mikael Carlsson, former CEO of Swedish logistics firm Kallebäck AB, sees that there is already a place for automation in haulage across colder climates. He explains, “Winters tend to be long and harsh in Scandinavia and this results in many traffic challenges. Often in extreme weather, technology is the first thing to fail. Sweden has many stretches of road with poor lighting, few road markings, black ice and substantial ice drifts.” Automation, executed well, could help to overcome these challenges, but based on current evidence, he’s not sure it’s there just yet, saying “It takes an experienced driver to navigate these and at the moment, I’m not convinced the tech is up to the challenge.”
 
Whether it is ready now or still a way off, transferring driverless technology into snowy conditions will undoubtedly bring benefits to all. The ability to clear airport runways will mean freedom of movement which is currently often blocked by adverse weather. It could mean more efficient delivery of goods, safer journeys on otherwise dangerous roads and will further open up travel in places where snow is a common sight. We’re excited to see where the road might take us.
 
Do you think snow-clearing is a good job for AVs? Would you trust a driverless vehicle in poor weather conditions? What could safe travel through snow mean for you? We’d love to know what you think. Share your thoughts in the comments below.

I think we can officially call it a trend now: autonomous concept vehicles have a tendency to look…well, let’s say peculiar. We all remember the VW Sedric, dubbed by some as a “giant toaster”. Volvo’s recent 360c concept also had more to offer on the inside than on the outside. Not to be left out, Mercedes launched its new concept car last week; and it’s one that spectators unanimously judged to be futuristic – and kind of ugly.
 
 “Once the customer’s priorities shift, the car’s aesthetic might give way to comfort and functionality,” we concluded in our analysis of the VW Sedric last year. And this couldn’t be more true for the Mercedes Vision Urbanetic: a self-driving, electrically powered van that is all about flexibility. With the Urbanetic, Mercedes aims to eliminate “the separation between people moving and goods transport.” At the core of the concept is a chassis that can take different switchable bodies. It can serve as a people mover for ride-sharing, offering space for up to twelve passengers before switching to the cargo module, which can transport up to ten EPAL palettes – or serve as a mobile package station. “During the daytime rush hours, Vision URBANETIC transports mainly people then switches to city-centre goods transportation at night,” says Volker Mornhinweg, Head of Mercedes-Benz Vans.
 
While both Volvo’s and Mercedes’ latest concepts offer a thought-provoking glimpse into the feature, Mercedes to me is the clear winner when it comes to societal value. With its flexible approach, the Urbanetic has the potential to tackle urban gridlock by reducing the number of vehicles on our roads. Volvo, on the other hand, introduced its vehicle by asking: “Why fly when you can be driven?” It’s pretty obvious that this vision would not lead to less congestion on our roads. But it should be up to the us – the public – whether this idea will fly or not.
 


SECRECY FIRST, SAFETY SECOND
How much regulation for autonomous driving is justified to ensure safety without hampering progress? The Trump administration has so far taken a rather industry-friendly approach. The U.S. Department of Transportation released self-driving guidelines in 2017. They asked carmakers to voluntarily outline how they are developing and testing self-driving cars on public roads.









The outcome is alarming. 55 companies are currently testing driverless cars in the state of California. But according to The Detroit News, only three of them have handed in safety assessments – namely General Motors, Ford and Waymo. Among the no-showers are industry giants like Volkswagen, Hyundai and Toyota. To make matters worse, the paper notes that the reports that have been submitted so far “resemble slick marketing brochures instead of stringent regulatory filings.”
 
Now it doesn’t come as a surprise that carmakers working on autonomous driving technology won’t give away internal corporate information as long as they don’t have to. This is why the U.S. senate is already working on a bill that would make safety assessments mandatory. Let’s hope it arrives in time. According to a recent study by Cox Automotive, 49 percent of U.S. consumers say they would never buy a Level 5 vehicle: up from 30 percent in 2016. The only way to reverse this trend is by creating trust – which won’t happen if consumers have the impression that carmakers don’t put safety first.
 


SAFE IN NEW YORK CITY
 
Safety concerns also seem to be at the center GM’s struggle to get a prestigious self-driving testing license in Manhattan. In October 2017, the company had announced that its autonomous driving unit Cruise will apply for a permit in the New York City borough. Fast forward to almost a year later – and GM is still pretty much at square one.








While New York State governor Andrew Cuomo had welcomed the announcement, NYC mayor Bill de Blasio is taking a more skeptical stance. “The Mayor has concerns about safety and testing an unproven technology on the busy streets of lower Manhattan,” a spokesperson of de Blasio told Jalopnik. GM claims it has “mapped a significant portion of NYC,” but talks with de Blasio seem to have stalled. “New York is a complex regulatory environment and we continue to work with stakeholders on next steps,” a spokesperson said rather vaguely.
 
With California and Arizona openly courting carmakers to test driverless technology in their states, it is easy to forget that they are not representative for the whole country. Political objections remain considerable in many states. More transparency would go a long way towards changing the climate – maybe start with trustworthy safety assessments?

Klaus Fröhlich, Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development, outlines his strategy.

It is still too early to write a history of automated driving, yet a number of inter-connected developments are beginning to emerge. Ten years ago, for example, a small start-up from Israel shot to fame when BMW presented the first “vehicle that can see”: a BMW 5 Series limousine with Mobileye cameras and photo recognition software. Today, this expert in camera-based environmental recognition is working with all the leading car manufacturers – and has just become part of the Intel Corporation: “In a form of reversed integration, we’ve put all our automated driving activities in the hands of Mobileye boss Amnon Shashua,” explains CEO of Intel Brian Krzanich.
 
Despite now being in the same boat, supertanker Intel is giving smaller and speedier Mobileye plenty of room to maneuver. In order to push the project forward as quickly as possible, Shashua is largely free to make decisions, emphasizes Krzanich. Know-how, financial power and speed are required in equal measure. ""If approaching this process step by step, it would have taken about 20 years to get from Level 2 to Level 5,"" says BMW’s Head of Development Klaus Fröhlich. However, now the upgrade of cars to driverless supercomputers is expected to happen in one revolutionary fell swoop. ""We defined the technical system by bringing Mobileye, Intel and BMW together. This took 9 months,"" says Fröhlich, ""but now that the system is robust, we’re looking for partners.
 
DRIVERLESS CARS: THE INDUSTRY IS PARTNERING
 
 

In addition to Continental and Delphi, Fröhlich has now secured Magna as another Tier 1 supplier for the non-exclusive cooperation: ""Three suppliers are sufficient for now, otherwise it will be too complex at some point. And we are assuming that the partnering with other car manufacturers has only just begun."" Such a global network is important he says given that autonomous driving regulation will be in constant interplay with the progress of technical systems over the next 20 years. ""At some point, all vehicles will use the same driverless technology. That's why we don’t think it makes sense to try to differentiate in the long term.""





      Klaus Fröhlich is Member of the Board of Management of BMW AG, Development. (Photo: BMW)
    


Nevertheless, Munich-based companies want to get ahead and shape standards as far as possible. According to Fröhlich, BMW will have made a high single-digit billion investment for the first generation of technology by 2021. ""Not everyone will be able to afford that. Nor does everyone have in-house expertise. Therefore, car manufacturers will have to enter into a cooperation at some point,"" he predicts. Fröhlich speaks of a ""deadline for development contributions"" at the end of this year, given that the existing cooperation is already setting up test fleets: ""We are jumping to Level 5 and will be equipping 40 BMW 7 Series this year,"" says Fröhlich. In his opinion, this fleet of very expensive test vehicles is not yet large enough; therefore the network will be expanded by additional strategic partners.  
 
FIAT CHRYSLER TO COOPERATE WITH BMW
 
Fiat Chrysler is the first associated car manufacturer, but Fröhlich is sure that more will follow by the end of the year. ""If we want to be ready by 2021, then 2018 will already be too late for new partnerships. In order to complete the system, all tasks need to be completely assigned."" It is important to achieve geographic diversity, he explains: ""We want to have a Chinese partner, an American partner and a European partner."" All those that come knocking at the door from 2018 can use the finished system as an industrialization partner. ""Every partner adds value. For example, Fiat Chrysler will operate fleets in the USA,"" explains Fröhlich, “even software development will be outsourced, which is also an area where Fiat Chrysler could get involved.""




      Hands off: BMW is testing all levels of automated driving. (Photo: BMW)
    


When it comes to imagining driving without human intervention, Fröhlich provides two examples: ""When I go shopping, I’d like to get out of the car right in front of a department store. The car could then go and find a parking space itself.” Of course, this automated chauffeur service doesn’t come without challenges: The car would have to estimate where every pedestrian on the roadside might walk. This is less of an issue on highways without any pedestrians nearby or any oncoming traffic he says: ""Driving 600 kilometers in traffic on a Friday afternoon is never pleasant. I’d like to be able to just push a button and let the car drive. Mind you, that requires Level 4.”
 
Upon request, the BMW technology boss is able to imagine another development partnership for next year: ""With someone who takes on a sub-task. Let’s say perhaps a downgraded version of a robot taxi for metropolitan areas."" When it comes to autonomous cars for cities, nobody has more experience than Google/Waymo. Interestingly, it is Fiat Chrysler, of all companies, that has already built 100 autonomous Chrysler Pacifica vans together with Waymo. It could just be coincidence, but Brian Krzanich has also just announced a closer development partnership with Waymo. Intel will provide the technology needed to bring robotic cars to inner cities. This is something that all players in the open cooperation will benefit from – directly or indirectly.

While the police has already exonerated Uber, the crash still marks a crucial point for driverless mobility. The struggle for public trust has taken a huge hit.
It’s the moment many people in the car industry have feared: for the first time, a fully autonomous car is reported to have killed a person. The self-driving Uber struck and killed a 49-year-old woman crossing a street in Tempe, Arizona, on Sunday night. Uber immediately halted their testing of driverless vehicles in Arizona, San Francisco, Toronto, and Pittsburgh. “We’re thinking of the victim’s family as we work with local law enforcement to understand what happened,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a tweet.
 
The fatal crash has instantly spurred intense media scrutiny worldwide. It could seriously alter the further development and roll-out of the technology because it raises many urgent questions. Among them: why did technology fail to prevent the crash? Is testing in urban scenarios still too risky for this moment in time? Is Arizona’s lax regulatory approach still justifiable? And has the multi-billion-dollar race towards autonomous driving led carmakers to rush?
 
THE CRASH
The crash occurred around 10 pm in Tempe near a busy intersection with multiple lanes in every direction. A 49-year old woman was pushing her bicycle across the street when she was hit by a self-driving Uber vehicle. The Volvo XC90 SUV was travelling in autonomous mode at a speed of 38 miles per hour and showed no signs of slowing down, the police said according to The Verge. A safety driver behind the wheel wasn’t able to retake control in time to prevent the imminent accident. Tempe’s Police chief Sylvia Moir told the San Francisco Chronicle: “The driver said it was like a flash, the person walked out in front of them.” The crash happened roughly 100 yards away from a crosswalk.
Following a preliminary investigation of the video footage taken by the Volvo’s on-board cameras, Moir said that the ride-hailing service was likely not at fault for the accident. From watching the videos, “it’s very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway.”
 
[UPDATE: The police released the dash-cam video of the immediate moments before the crash on Wednesday. As can be seen, the backup driver wasn't giving his full attention to the road. This could raise the question whether Moir's assessment will hold true – and why the car's sensors failed to detect the pedestrian. Click here for further analysis in our column ""The Week in Automated Driving"".] 




Play






Inevitably, the accident evokes memories of the fatal Tesla crash in 2016 when a Model S electric sedan car set to Autopilot collided with a truck in Florida, killing the Tesla driver. The difference, however, is that the Autopilot is merely a driver assistance system with level 2 automation. A report later concluded that Brown had received multiple warnings to retake the wheel. The Uber accident now marks the first time a vulnerable road user has been killed by a fully autonomous car.
 
TECHNOLOGY AND TESTING
While the police has already exonerated Uber, the question remains if the technology functioned as it should have. Notably, the autonomous car was driving above the speed limit of 35 miles per hour. According to Wired, conditions on Sunday were warm with little wind – which means nothing should have blurred the car’s vision. Could the car have avoided the pedestrian by swerving into another lane?
Critics caution that the industry is rushing premature technology onto the roads. “The car cameras, the vision systems, they don’t perform inductively, meaning they can’t guess about the appearance of someone in a particular place and time,” Missy Cummings, robotic expert at Duke University, told the Washington Post. It begs the question: should autonomous cars be kept out of inner-city areas as long as they cannot cope with all facets of urban traffic – like pedestrians emerging “from the shadows”?
Others will argue that this very crash proves the need for further real-life testing in those areas. Road testing is the only way the systems can learn and adjust to their environments, eventually reaching a level of safety that cuts down on the number of motor vehicle deaths overall, Timothy Carone, associate teaching professor at University of Notre Dame, told the Post.
 
THE REGULATION
It’s no coincidence that Uber and its competitors like Waymo have been heavily testing autonomous vehicles in Arizona. The state has very actively been courting driverless car companies and is known for its somewhat ‘light’ regulation. “Arizona welcomes Uber self-driving cars with open arms and wide open roads,” Governor Doug Ducey said in 2016. “While California puts the brakes on innovation and change with more bureaucracy and more regulation, Arizona is paving the way for new technology and new businesses.”
 
A battle of de-regulation has unfolded between U.S. states like Arizona, California and Nevada. Both Arizona and California have recently passed laws that allow companies to test autonomous vehicles on public roads without a backup driver present – if they meet certain safety requirements. It will be interesting to see how the Tempe incident could affect such a rule – especially since U.S. Congress is considering a national framework that would preempt states from establishing their own laws. “This tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers, pedestrians, and drivers who share America’s roads,” U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal said in a statement. “In our haste to enable innovation, we cannot forget basic safety.”
 
THE INDUSTRY AND PUBLIC TRUST
Does the aforementioned “haste to enable innovation” increase the risk of fatal accidents? There is no evidence at the moment to suggest so. But as more and more public testing gets underway, the statistical likelihood of further road casualties caused by autonomous cars increases. Professor Armin Grunwald, a renowned technology assessor for the German parliament, said in an interview with 2025AD in 2016 that “at some point, this complex technology in some specific situation will have a malfunction and cause an accident. And people will be harmed by it. This will spur debates.” At the same time, Grunwald predicted that “if autonomous driving can reduce a large proportion of those road deaths, the public will accept it.”“One thing seems certain,” 2025AD wrote after the fatal Tesla accident in 2016. “The reactions to the fatal crash will show just how willing both consumers and lawmakers are to trust in future technologies.” We know today that they didn’t reject the technology as a whole, just like Armin Grunwald predicted. But the entire driverless car industry will have to work hard to ensure the public doesn’t lose their trust. The only way to do that? By being transparent, by admitting mistakes – and by only putting safe technology on our roads.

In an exclusive interview with 2025AD, the U.S. entrepreneur explains why navigation databases will save lives – and why he is not a fan of Tesla.

Russ Shields is not a man who seeks publicity. Interviews with him are rare. That is why there are even automotive experts who have not heard of the U.S. businessman. But don’t be fooled by his media absence: when it comes to automated mobility, Shields is a big presence. His company Navteq evolved into HERE – a key player in navigational maps, now owned by BMW, Audi and Mercedes. Today, his company Ygomi is developing complex solutions for road network databases – a prerequisite for autonomous driving.
 
2025AD: Mr. Shields, you are known as a gambler. During your college time you were a successful poker player. If you had to bet on the year we will see fully autonomous series vehicles on our roads, which year would it be?
Russ Shields: Cars with SAE level 4 automation, which is highly automated driving, will probably be on the market in 2020 or 2021 – on limited expressways. By 2025, there will be more and more roads covered, possibly even country or mountain roads. But a true door-to-door autonomous car on all public roads – SAE level 5 automation – is many, many years away. We are probably talking about the 2030s.
 
2025AD: What you say is in line with the position of the big German OEMs. Some American companies like Google sometimes give the impression that they will be able to pull off a level 5 vehicle that can drive on any roads in the next couple of years. Are you more skeptical about that?
Russ Shields: Google has gotten under pressure recently. They are now focusing on very constrained areas, not all roads. And even these won’t become a reality within the next couple of years. Similarly, Ford is eyeing 2021 for a shuttle vehicle in a closed area – not something that is for widespread sale. And I don’t hear anything different from Ford, GM or the Japanese companies like Toyota or Nissan from what the German manufacturers are expecting over the next ten years. Uber might be pressing for a quicker approach but I’d be surprised if they could get an SAE level 5 vehicle on the road in the near future. They just don’t know how hard it is.
 
2025AD: You are someone who likes to take a clear stance. In 2015, you dismissed the Google car as “a joke”. What led to your opinion?
Russ Shields: I still think so today. But they have moved their objectives. Now they are saying they’re not really building a car. Instead, they plan to license technology to vehicle manufacturers because they do have some very good technology. This makes their work more practical.
 
2025AD: One of the key prerequisites for automated cars is digital maps. You are one of the pioneers of digital mapping technology. Under your leadership Navteq became the world’s most comprehensive navigable database. At what point did you realize how important this technology was for automated driving?
Russ Shields: We did early pilots in the late 1990s on how electronic maps could improve safety systems like adaptive cruise control with lane handling. At that point, there was no serious thinking about highly automated driving. It’s only really been in the last few years that the potential became obvious.
 

2025AD: Navteq has had quite an interesting career. It was sold to Nokia, then renamed HERE which was then bought by Audi, Mercedes and BMW. How do you assess the future prospects of the platform?
Russ Shields: The crucial question is: Will they be able to create the software necessary for the machine part of future vehicle generations? They have good experience and a good market share. But the technology requirements are evolving. Mapping technology for humans – like navigation and telematics – is very different from the machine-oriented technology which we need for SAE level 5 automated driving.
 
2025AD: What is the difference?
Russ Shields: The so-called road network databases for autonomous cars require a much higher level of accuracy and reliability. Mistakes in navigation systems happen all the time. But for the machine-to-machine uses of the database, mistakes in navigation systems can end up killing people. Avoiding that is the challenge that HERE and other map companies face. How will they keep their very successful human-oriented business and create the complex, highly reliable software for the machine-oriented part of the business at the same time?
 
2025AD: There are several other players besides HERE who work on road network databases. Will there at some point be a need for those mapping giants to create common standards?
Russ Shields: To create standards for a complicated technology before it gets into the market is pretty hard. We are a long way from even having standards for chip sets. So it’s unlikely that we will have any kind of successful software standards even long after the systems are on the market and reliable.

2025AD: Since you are an expert for Asian markets, do you see any specific challenges for digital mapping in this region?
Russ Shields: The database needs to accurately reflect what’s on the road. Every area of the world has different conditions because they have different land uses, different population structures. So the software has to be tested and carefully adapted to each market. Additionally, there is no assurance that there won’t be interference by governments wanting to protect national businesses. That’s a risk that always exists.
 
2025AD: Your company Ygomi delivers innovative software and technology-based service for automotive manufacturers. Where does your focus lie when it comes to automated driving?  
Russ Shields: Our major target is to build a road network database for automated driving. We have been in the software business for 47 years and there has always been technological evolution. But today we can provide software that allows for things that were not at all possible and economically practical in the past.
 
2025AD: What new possibilities arise from this technological progress?
Russ Shields: For building a road network database, processors are now becoming fast enough to support highly automated driving in high-end cars. Eventually we will even get into mid-price and low-end cars. I expect that over the next 10 to 15 years, every new car built will include a road network database to support the safety systems.
 
2025AD: It seems like the media often focuses on a competition between German OEMs and Silicon Valley players. Do you think that the media underestimates the competitiveness of other regions, Asia in particular?
Russ Shields: I see a lot of potential in many Chinese companies with huge financial capabilities. They may evolve to be a successful vehicle manufacturer on the world stage – similar to the way that Japanese OEMs have become world-class competitors. Automation and electric powertrains will play a huge role in that regard. 20 years from now, I wouldn’t be surprised to see half of the world’s existing ten largest manufacturers having gone out of business with new ones having taken over their roles.
 
2025AD: With the recent incidents involving Tesla’s Autopilot, one could almost get the impression that autonomous driving is at a crucial point where trust in the technology is being tested…
Russ Shields: Even before Tesla released the Autopilot, many conservative voices said that automated driving is going to be very difficult to deploy – and that there will be cases where inadequate systems will be brought into the market. Then the release of the Autopilot raised a lot of questions. Many experts were saying that it was too early and not ready to be put into the market.
 
2025AD: What led to their criticism?
Russ Shields: Here’s one example: Tesla’s manual says that automated braking will only work if the object you are braking for is moving – and that you will hit a fixed object. That’s a level of incomplete technology that I would not expect most OEMs to allow in their products. I am familiar with at least five accidents that have happened with the Tesla Autopilot that have been publicly registered. Only two of those were fatal. But for the number of cars they have on the road, that’s a pretty high accident rate. Hopefully most car companies will be more careful in what they do then Tesla has been.
 
 


Will Chinese OEMs play a big role in automated driving? Will it be the 2030s before Level 5 automation hits our streets? What do you think of Russ Shields' assessments?

To catch up, German automaker Volkswagen is nudging its inhouse think tank Audi AID into competition with self-driving car start-up Aurora.

It came as a surprise to the automated driving community when Volkswagen announced its cooperation with Aurora, the California based start-up founded by automated driving veterans Chris Urmson, Sterling Anderson and Drew Bagnell.
 
A little over a year old, Aurora is already a heavy-weight in the industry. Urmson was the head of Google’s self-driving project before it became a spin-off called Waymo. Anderson was the director of the semi-autonomous autopilot program at Tesla and Drew Bagnell, one of the most respected experts on machine learning in the US, headed the autonomy and perception team at Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center.
 
While Aurora is an ideal partner in the automated driving world, industry insiders expected Volkswagen to keep AD development inhouse. Audi, the Bavaria-based car manufacturer and part of the Volkswagen group, spun off its subsidiary Autonomous Intelligent Driving (AID) in early 2017 to ready a level 5 car for series production. “Autonomous Intelligent Driving is working for the entire Volkswagen group,” Audi boss Rupert Stadler said at the time. Meanwhile, Wolfsburg, where the Volkswagen group is headquartered, was already working on an alternative. “We have been discussing a cooperation with Aurora since 2016. Talking became doing in mid-2017,” said group Chief Digital Officer Johann Jungwirth earlier this year.

Responsible for developing self-driving systems for the Volkswagen group, Jungwirth is stepping on the accelerator to keep up with tech companies such as Waymo and Uber. “It is important that we meet our timing goals,” Jungwirth told 2025AD.com at the Geneva International Motor Show (GIMS). “Aurora and AID are competing. We foster competition not just between service providers, but also with inhouse teams,” says Jungwirth. Volkswagen is aiming to put 50 test vehicles on the road this year. In 2019, the number is to increase by factor 10 before reaching 5,000 autonomous Volkswagen models in 2020.
 
 


A FINE BALANCE
Time is short and Aurora is taking the lead. Volkswagen’s ride hailing service Moia will be one of the first platforms to integrate Aurora products. To Jungwirth, the potential for a global roll-out and scalability is crucial. “The question is: Who is the first to scale up from five cities to 500 or even 5,000 – without clocking thousands of test miles in each new region?”
 
Yet fully automated driving may take some time, as Audi boss Stadler points out. “The level 5 robot cab will chauffeur its riders through a city around 2025 or 2030.” The challenges even of partially automated driving made themselves painfully obvious with the fatal Uber crash in Tempe, Arizona, in late March. A pedestrian died as neither the automated Volvo nor the safety driver managed to avoid the accident.
 
Safety is a prerequisite for automated driving. “It is not enough to have fair-weather-systems that work well in Phoenix or Houston, but not in Chicago, New York or Hamburg,” says Jungwirth. A high quality self-driving system must deliver all its functionality without human interception in all road conditions, be it snow, rain or darkness.

A gauge of firms’ ability to deliver this is provided by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Every December, DMV collects and publishes disengagement reports from all firms testing automated cars in California. Highlighting the number of incidents in which safety drivers interfered with the autonomous mode, this is a reliable indicator to assess the state of automated driving. According to the 2017 reports, Waymo’s vehicles cover an average of 9,000 kilometers before security drivers intervene. The company reported a total of 63 incidents in the 12 months between December 2016 and November 2017. This puts them ahead of most competitors, including their former employee’s new firm. “In this ranking, Aurora is among the top three and rising,” says Jungwirth.
 
 


A ROBOT CAR RACE WON BY PEOPLE
The man nicknamed J.J. is quite familiar with the set-up in California. Before joining Volkswagen, he headed Apple’s Titan project and closely observed events at Waymo. Aurora’s developing speed puts a spark in Jungwirth’s eyes. “They made phenomenal progress over the past 18 months because they focus on the very latest developing tools and sensors instead of dragging along millions of lines of outdated code.”
 
When recalling a ride in an Aurora prototype in January, Jungwirth becomes enthused. Taking off in Palo Alto, California, the vehicle passed through the urban areas along El Camino, where a mix of more than 30 traffic lights, pedestrians and construction sites puts the car to a test before it escapes the city onto highways. “The car drove for 40 minutes and 35 kilometers without a single intervention by the safety driver.” Radar, cameras, ultra sound and a large Velodyne lidar on the roof guided the vehicle. “On this year’s test vehicles, we will replace the large central sensor with four to six smaller lidars, much like our prototype Sedric,” Jungwirth says.

In the end, the race for automated driving will be won by people. Both Aurora and AID have around 100 employees and rising. Attracting some of the brightest in the industry, this further weakens their competitors. “Only a handful of self-driving systems providers will survive in the long run,” Jungwirth predicts. “In the US, China and Europe, it will be one or two per region. It is important that we take a two-pronged approach.“ The money spent on Aurora is a sensible investment, he says, even more so as the sums are “quite reasonable. We can also share the cost between partners such as Hyundai and Byton.”
 
The one or two platforms that come out ahead will dominate the market in their region. “The winner takes most. So as a provider, one must make an attractive offer right from the start: a comprehensive mobility service. This starts with self-driving systems and the autonomous vehicles, it continues with fleet operations, a control center and depot in the city and ends with an online interface and ride pooling for clients.” Surely, Volkswagen will be one of the top players making such a comprehensive offer – if the self-driving functionalities become available in time. “Landing a manned rocket on Mars is equally difficult,” Jungwirth says with a wry smile. He surely wants to be the first to set foot on this new planet.

Continental has developed an autonomous testing vehicle. Watch the prototype in action on the dusty roads of Texas.

Tire testing is a strenuous task under extreme climate and road conditions. At Continental’s testing ground in Uvalde, Texas, each test driver carries out one 8-hour test per day. Driving very slow speeds on a very short circuit, the drivers naturally start not paying attention to the road and lacking the concentration needed at some point. This is why Continental is introducing a driverless testing prototype. We visited the testing grounds in Texas to see the stunning outcome.

It’s time to say goodbye. The automaker of the 20th century – once regarded as a daring engineer who could confidently push vehicles to their physical limit – is now a discontinued model. Recently they have become more like pilots, supervising a host of assistants. Either way, it has always been man that has controlled (ever more powerful) machines. However, these are now fading myths of an analogue age. Developers have long been working on an automated world, where routine tasks can be performed without human supervision. It’s time for new thinking in many fields.
 
Whether in autonomous mobility services, logistics or production, the focus is the same: the aim is to develop a machine-to-machine economy in which robots are not only able to take over physical activities, but also communicate with each other and conclude binding contracts. To be truly autonomous, vehicles need digital agents that can independently perform tasks and approve payments – completely taking these responsibilities away from the driver. This includes paying for parking, road tariffs or battery recharging.
 
 


A HETEROGENOUS PAYING LANDSCAPE
At present, a wide range of billing systems, credit cards, parking cards and fuel cards are still required to navigate the extremely heterogeneous mobility landscape. What’s more, trustworthy identities are necessary in order to guarantee the validity of these transactions. When paying for something online, for example, a credit card helps little if you do not trust the provider of a good or service. This form of decentralized organization is not always secure enough. In addition, the process is designed for human actors: the customer must accept the displayed price by pressing a button – and remain the acting and legally responsible subject. 
 


In a machine-to-machine economy, such human actors are no longer necessary; provided the business rules are clearly defined and the identities of trading partners cannot be manipulated. To date, it has mainly been information that has been exchanged on the internet; with criminal data theft presenting one of the biggest problems. But there is another potential security breach: the identification of actors involved also needs urgent improvement. Blogs written by machines rather than humans have led to public debates regarding the reliability of authors. Business participants must therefore agree on cross-industry security standards before values or critical data can be securely transmitted.
 
So far, distributed-ledger technologies, such as blockchains, have been considered unhackable. This is in fact the central promise: a technology without middlemen that can organize data security in the swarm. Instead of storing data in a central database that is vulnerable to attacks, information is replicated on thousands of servers. Every record, whether a transfer, a contract or technical parameters, becomes inseparable from previous transactions. These chained together data blocks (hence the name blockchain) theoretically expose any third-party manipulation automatically. As each participant has an original of the digital cash book, so to speak, values such as money, shares, patents or property rights can be clearly assigned to an owner and securely transferred.
 
""The use of blockchain technology depends largely on the relationship of the participants and less on the technology of a use case,"" says Kurt Lehmann, Corporate Technology Officer at Continental: ""Conventional systems solve the trust issue by employing a reliable third party, making these systems unnecessarily complex. A blockchain offers a more elegant and efficient way to implement the actual use case.""
 
 
BITCOIN: A TRUSTWORTHY ALTERNATIVE?
We are all familiar with trusted third parties such as notaries, banks or credit card companies, whose services, not to mention trustworthiness, can be paid for in the form of transaction fees. When it comes to micropayments or nanopayments, however, these fees can be higher than the actual usage fee. Another trustworthy entity is a central bank that can control its currency. But counterfeit security also plays an important role here, while financial markets or political influences are always subject to certain new rules and restrictions. Digital currencies such as Bitcoin have emerged as an alternative means of payment – even if the recent extreme price fluctuations weren’t great for boosting confidence in the new technology.
 
Blockchain-based mobility platform Car eWallet, introduced by German firm ZF Friedrichshafen AG in January 2017, can do without a new currency. It significantly simplifies technical services, digital commerce and cashless payment between manufacturers, suppliers, service providers and customers. ""We are building a B2B marketplace where we connect service providers with customers. This marketplace has to be neutral, otherwise it will not be accepted,"" says Alexander Graf co-inventor and manager of Car eWallet.
 
As the business partners on this B2B platform know each other, they can work with payment terms and schedules. In this standard post-pay procedure, the delivered goods and services are added up and invoiced after 60 days. Distributed ledger technologies work well as every partner has a piece of the system, thus making it transparent. ""It is clear who is doing business with each other. This is also ideal from a security perspective,"" says Graf.

THE BIG PROMISE: UNHACKABLE TRANSACTIONS
""Blockchain uses the latest encryption and digital signature practices, based on asymmetric cryptography, which are currently considered unbreakable,"" says Kurt Lehmann. ""A technological threat will only emerge once quantum computers have the ability to calculate the cryptographic key in adequate time."" Continental researchers are therefore currently working on so-called post-quantum cryptography procedures. Blockchain concepts that are less processing-intensive than Bitcoin for example are also a top priority.
 
For now, it’s a matter of first making the new technology known in the traditional automotive sector. At the beginning of May, several OEMs, suppliers and other players launched the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI). The initiative will initially develop uniform international standards, as well as a network for new mobility services in which industrial giants can connect with start-ups.
 
 


NEW BUSINESS MODELS: WHO WILL BE THE WINNER?
Driven by new shared-mobility providers and a large number of start-ups from the financial sector (so-called fintech start-ups), automakers will have to become active. ""We can certainly imagine managing topics such as payments or contracts (smart contracts), logbooks or repair checkbooks with the help of blockchains,"" says a Daimler spokesman. BMW is interested in identifying each vehicle with a VIN (vehicle identification number) and providing individual maintenance histories using blockchains. With all the technical parameters, services such as predictive maintenance can be developed into digital business models.
 
If this logic is broken down to the level of the individual vehicle parts, the required processing capacity becomes even greater. Audi experts are examining how far linked-database technology can be used to map and document international logistics processes. Theoretically, the entire flow of parts during production could be tracked, including purchasing and quality control. It would then be possible to determine whether original parts remain in use throughout the service life of a vehicle. Even classic automotive suppliers want to combine their detailed vehicle knowledge with new data-based business models. The advantage is higher margins – although in the development of such business models, Silicon Valley has so far been more creative than German engineers.

Here is why.
 

The market for autonomous delivery is buzzing. Companies like Ford, Daimler and Toyota as well as start-ups such as Nuro, Udelv, Starship Technologies, Boxbot, and Robby Technologies are all crowding in. But what has triggered this rush? What strategies do these players pursue? And how far are they in delivering goods automatically?
 
To understand the excitement start with an assessment by McKinsey. The consultancy calculated that the global annual market for parcel delivery amounted to €70 billion with growth rates of 7-10% in mature markets and 300% in developing countries such as India. By 2025 up to 80% of parcels would be delivered autonomously, particularly on the labour-intensive last mile where about half the costs arise.
 

Training behind closed doors
A decisive company has been Amazon. In 2012 it bought Kiva Systems, a manufacturer of delivery robots for warehouses. These miniature cities with fewer regulations have been an ideal training ground, says Jim Adler, managing director of Toyota AI Ventures. Amazon’s purchase of Kiva was an “inflection point”, he recently explained. “The same autonomous technologies (i.e. sensors, perception, prediction, planning) used to pack boxes in warehouses are now being pressed into the service of delivering those packages to your door.”

Indeed, in early 2018 Amazon applied for a patent for its “autonomous ground vehicle” (AGV). This robot can be stationed outside apartment blocks to carry parcels from delivery trucks to a client’s house. The robots can potentially even open doors to flats using the company’s new camera controlled smart lock system called Amazon Key.
 


All shapes and sizes
 
Other companies have caught on, pursuing one of three strategies. First, manufacturers like Ford are adapting existing car models. The Detroit-based company has teamed up with the courier service Postmates and the pizza seller Domino’s. Thus it modified Transit Connect vans by integrating two lockers in the rear and one on the side to test a meal-delivery system in Miami, Ann Arbor and Las Vegas. The vans are driven by humans, but made to appear like self-driving cars to study customers’ interaction with autonomous vehicles.
 
A second approach is that of Nuro. The start-up from Mountain View was founded in 2016 by two former leading engineers of Google’s self-driving car project Waymo. With more than 100 employees today Nuro has developed the R1, an autonomous delivery car designed from scratch with LIDAR, cameras, radars and a completely new software stack – but with no driver’s seat or steering wheel.

Pundits have compared the R1 to a “mobile toaster”. But two successful funding rounds for a combined sum of €80 million suggest that investors believe in the car’s design. It only weighs 680 kilograms, can carry a load of 110 kilograms and is only about 1 meter wide. This reduced scale helps avoiding collisions, the founders explain. In August, Nuro started joint test trials with the supermarket retailer Kroger in Arizona delivering groceries for a flat fee of about €5.
 
Initially, the pilot project still uses Toyota Prius cars equipped with self-driving features similar to those of R1, but controlled by human safety drivers, as the company concedes. “The goal is to learn as much as we can from our customers and our respective operations teams,” says a spokesperson. “We will introduce R1 this fall into the pilot.”
 


Small is beautiful
Finally, other companies use robots scaled back even further to drive at walking speed on pavements. These vehicles often look like oversized mobile cooler boxes. Some of them have four wheels like Amazon’s AGV and a similar, though already unveiled, vehicle by Oakland-based Boxbot. Others have six wheels such as the robots by London-based Starship Technologies and its competitor Robby Technologies from Palo Alto.

According to a study by the consultancy Frost & Sullivan such robots weigh between 11 and 36 kilograms, have a load capacity similar to their weight, a range of up to 16 kilometres, a battery life of up to 12 hours and a price between €1700 and €26.000. In test trials the robots are usually still monitored by humans. However, Frost & Sullivan predicts, “by 2020 delivery bots will be 99% autonomous.”
 
There are several reasons why self-driving vehicles for delivery mature faster than those for passengers. First, they are usually smaller and slower and thus easier to steer and stop; second, they can take their time to process and solve unforeseen problems; and finally, with no passengers and often considerably less weight the risk associated with collisions is reduced.
 
However, driverless delivery doesn’t come without challenges. It remains to be seen how robots that use sidewalks will navigate amongst hundreds of pedestrians in extremely busy city centres, if people will trust robots to enter into their houses and how these robots will reach apartments that lie higher than the ground level.
 
Toyota’s Jim Adler knows such obstacles and expects, “it will be years before we share roads with Level 5 self-driving cars.” Though when his company invested in Boxbot in June he predicted. “There are specific use cases where autonomous vehicles could hit the roads now.

But just how realistic are these industry promises? Dr. Cyriel Diels, an expert in comfort experience, warns of an underrated risk that could threaten the success of the technology as a whole.
Passengers need to trust an autonomous vehicle in order to feel comfortable – that is one of Dr Cyriel Diels’ core beliefs. At Car HMI 2017 in April, he said: „Car and user must form a relationship - we need to evolve from Human Machine Interaction (HMI) to Human Robot Relationship (HRR).” Diels, a Human Factors scientist at Coventry University, focuses his research on the comfort experience in driverless vehicles.  In an interview with 2025AD, he explains why many people could feel sick in self-driving cars – and why the car industry urgently needs to tackle this problem.
 
 
2025AD: Dr Diels, your research focuses on passenger comfort in autonomous vehicles. What fascinates you about the topic?
 
Dr Cyriel Diels: I think that comfort is going to be the key requirement for future vehicles. The automotive industry is really selling the idea that vehicle automation will allow us to do all sorts of tasks – relaxing, reading, writing. However, the problem is that a lot of those tasks will actually be quite difficult to perform in comfort. For instance, we have to think about passenger safety implications. What happens if you have an accident and your tablet computer is between you and the airbag? A lot of the concepts being developed seem to ignore some very basic things we know from work station design. They can be considered quite naive.  
 
 
2025AD: Do you think they are naive or is the industry knowingly overpromising?
 
Diels: If you talk to engineers, they probably wouldn’t agree that within the next 10 to 15 years, vehicles will look extremely different and allow us to do all these things. Even if it were possible, a lot of concepts are designed around technology, rather than people. It’s about putting as many displays in the vehicle as possible without asking: do people actually want to use this?
 
 
2025AD: How does interior design have to change to be designed around humans and their comfort?
 
Diels: You need to start from the perspective: what are comfortable postures? Any deviation from that will take effort and strain the body. That’s much better than putting a display into the ceiling just because it looks cool – not realizing that it’s not in line with a natural position.
 
 
2025AD: What challenges arise from the fact that a vehicle is autonomous?
 
Diels: Mixed traffic conditions will cause several challenges. Unless we segregate the traffic completely, there is no way to prevent conventional vehicles from colliding with autonomous vehicles. So therefore, the safety requirements will not be much different to what we see now. This also has a psychological impact: if we know we are not much safer in our car, than a perception of risk is still present.

2025AD: That would also mean that many of the alternative seating arrangements we see in concept cars would not actually be a safe design for such a car.
 
Diels: And if you know accidents still might happen, how confident would you be traveling facing backwards?
 
 
2025AD: It doesn’t seem media or industry are talking a lot about motion sickness caused by riding in a driverless car. According to you, it’s one of the most striking problems.
 
Diels: It’s likely to become a much bigger issue – and an absolutely critical one as well. The premise of the technology is that we are able to do something other than driving. This is jeopardized by the fact that we may feel sick. And even if we don’t have full-blown symptoms, even the slightest unwell feeling will completely challenge the user experience.  
 
 
2025AD: Why might the level of sickness be higher than in a conventional car?
 
Diels: First of all, as a driver, you are less prone to motion sickness because you know exactly where you are steering. Motion sickness occurs when the sensed motion is different to what we expect to sense. So overall, everybody will become more susceptible as a passenger. Secondly, if we want to engage in non-driving related tasks, this may lead to sensory conflicts. If you read a book while being driven in a car, what you perceive with your eyes is a stationary environment. But what you perceive with your balance system is actually a moving environment.
 
 
2025AD: What can be done to reduce the motion sickness?
 
Diels: First, we need to avoid low-frequency motion patterns, like in stop-and-go traffic. But unfortunately you are also dependent on the traffic around you. Second, we need to allow occupants to anticipate the future motion. If you don’t know where you are going, you are more likely to get sick. Maybe we have to provide additional motion cues – be it auditory, tactile, haptic or visual. And third, we need to design displays that reduce the amount of sensory conflicts. As an example, positioning a see-through or augmented reality display near the line of sight so people are still able to see out of the vehicle.
 
 
2025AD: At Car HMI 2017, one of the suggestions was to implement frosted glass into the cars so passengers would not get conflicting motion cues.
 
Diels: This would only work in certain conditions. Our balance system senses acceleration. So if we are traveling at a constant speed on the motorway, we essentially don’t sense any motion. If you frost the windows, for your brain it would appear that you are in a stationary environment. If you start reading now or sleeping, there is no problem. It’s like being below deck on board a ship. However, if there is any acceleration or deceleration, we induce quite a severe sensory conflict. Moreover, I think people would still at least like to have the option to look out of the window to create trust. And don’t forget that a lot of people actually enjoy looking out of the window.

2025AD: Do you think that we will get more used to those new motion experiences over time?
 
Diels: We know that people adapt to environments that make them feel sick. If you are aboard a ship, you develop so-called sea legs. Over time, people get used to certain motion profiles after a constant exposure to them. But in road transport, the big difference is that we have a choice. We can actually stop the car, we can change our routes. So that opens up the research question: do people actually adapt under these circumstances?
 
 
2025AD: You also research passenger comfort in aviation. What can we learn from that field?
 
Diels: It starts with the irony that we’ve had passenger vehicles for more than 100 years, but from the beginning they have been designed for the driver. If you look at trim levels, at the budgets of front versus rear: it’s all about the driver experience. It’s understandable if you consider that the average car occupancy in Europe is around 1.2. Why would the industry design for passengers if the car is only used by passengers once in a blue moon? But now we have shared automated vehicles, we have to start from scratch. And one of the industries where the passengers have also been at the forefront is aviation.  
 
 
2025AD: In the future, car ownership may no longer be the norm. If vehicles are more likely to be shared, how will this affect the interior design of cars?
 
Diels: There might be situations where we want to be isolated so we have to adopt some sort of cocooning approach. On the other hand, there will be times where interaction is desired – so we have to take more of a stagecoach approach. Flexibility will be key. We need to embrace opportunities, but we need to respect certain basic human requirements. We can’t just wildly come up with ideas and designs.

But who is responsible, if “robot cars” do crash? Accident liability in a driverless future raises some tricky questions. We asked experts from both sides of the Atlantic about it.
Road traffic as we know it is on the verge of a sea change: the transition from vehicles driven by humans to vehicles driven more and more by themselves. Built to an unprecedented level of safety, these connected cars will dramatically lower the number of accidents worldwide.But as automation is gradually introduced on our roads, there might still be crashes. Imagine a car – traveling in self-driving mode – hitting a pedestrian. Or two autonomous cars smashing into each other.Scenarios like these are causing legal experts some headaches: who’s at fault if automation fails? And who pays, if robot systems cause a collision? 
 
NO CHANGES TO THE LAW
Some commentators even go so far as to doubt whether automated driving has a future at all amidst unresolved regulatory and liability questions. But there is reason for optimism, says Jacob Fuest. “We don’t see liability getting more complicated in a driverless future,” the Head of the Automotive Innovation Center at Allianz tells 2025AD. Existing laws in a majority of countries in the European Union would well be able to handle liability even in complex crash scenarios. “Currently, we see no need for action on the side of insurance and liability law,” Fuest explains.
 
Across the pond, legal experts tend to agree. “Law is a flexible creature”, U.S. attorney Andrew Garza explains in an interview with 2025AD. According to Garza, who heads the Law Offices of Andrew P. Garza in Connecticut, future liability cases will likely be handled the same way as today. Even if they involve autonomous cars, they can be addressed through existing product liability regulations. “Will there be a learning curve? Sure,” Mr Garza says. “But ultimately, our liability framework that has existed for hundreds of years will be well-adapted to handle the change.""
 
 
A HUMAN WILL STILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE
Now what does this mean in practice? Imagine you’re driving on a highway in the year 2025. You’re checking e-mail while your brand new car is cruising in autonomous mode. All of a sudden, it wrongfully changes the lane and touches an “innocent” vehicle. According to Jacob Fuest, it is you yourself, who will, in the first instance, be liable for the damage caused by your car. “The basic legal principle of strict liability will endure,” says Fuest. This means: the person in charge of the car is liable for both individual mistakes and defects of the vehicle.
 
So no matter if you or your car were in control at the moment of the collision, accountability will first be assigned to you. Your vehicle insurance will pay for damages done to other road users. As Mr Fuest explains, the overarching doctrine of victim protection makes a swift, no-questions-asked compensation an utter necessity. “We cannot and will never expect crash victims to press charges against manufacturers or other parties.”
 
But of course, that is not the end of it. What if the crash wasn’t really your fault? What if a malfunction of the autonomous features caused the accident? In this case, your insurance will, in a second step, approach the car’s manufacturer or other parties involved to seek recovery for its advance payments. In the same way, the insurer will proceed with damages to your own car.
 
 
 
WHO’S TO BLAME? A BLACK BOX WILL DETERMINE THAT
When insurances and manufacturers sit down, the real blame game begins. The crunch question will be: who was the perpetrator – man or machine? And if the human is ruled out, then what exactly caused the crash? A brake malfunction or faulty sensor information? Compromised software or flawed mapping data?
 
In connected vehicles that communicate with other cars and perceive their surrounding world in 3D, all of this seems possible. To unravel the complex technical entanglements of a driverless accident, data will be key. Specifically, so-called event data recorders may bring everybody closer to an answer.
 
Once automated driving arrives on our roads, these devices will become more prevalent. Fire and shock-proof, the appliances are similar to the black boxes of airplanes. Working like a log book, they store relevant information to shed light on what went on in the decisive seconds before a crash. In future automated driving, they will be designed to also record the car’s driving mode (autonomous or manual). The system will be able to register faults in the assistance systems, software bugs or network failures that may freeze a vehicle’s communication with other cars (V2X).
 
“This will resolve most liability issues,” Andrew Garza predicts. “Maybe there won’t even be a need for eye-witnesses to say ‘this is what I saw’. Instead, we’ll let the data show. That’s the best evidence we can have. Reviewing that data will be a game-changer.”

OPEN QUESTIONS REMAIN
While the data from these recorders may provide answers, their collection raises further questions. According to Jacob Fuest, key challenges will be to solve sensitive issues of data privacy and to standardize processes between carmakers and insurers: “Which exact data do we need to determine what happened? And how do we ask permission to access it? First and foremost, any given data is owned by the customer.”
 
With an increasing degree of automation, Jacob Fuest expects the onus to be on manufacturers to prove their cars were not at fault in the event of a crash. Volvo has already claimed it will take full liability for damages caused by its driverless cars. Once carmakers start selling more automated vehicles and we start living in an autonomous car reality, “automakers will be taken by their word”, Andrew Garza expects.
 
Things will get trickier on the manufacturer’s side as more and more external parties such as software developers or mobile network operators enter the field. “With automated driving on the rise, we have a significant increase of players,” Fuest observes. In order to address liability proactively, there will likely be more mutual agreements on indemnification between parties to protect themselves against damage claims.

THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES
In the U.S., punitive damages may still pose the biggest threat to the car industry. After all, if an autonomous vehicle is “found guilty”, carmakers might be confronted with further claims regarding compensation for crash victims’ personal suffering.
 
Could the classic “million dollar trial”, hanging like a sword of Damocles over the industry, impede or even prevent consumer access to automated mobility? Chances are it won’t. “I do think autonomous driving is an inevitability,” Mr Garza asserts. “These cars will be available. And although it’s also inevitable that some carmakers will be too cautious, enough companies will recognize the benefits in the long haul.” Also, Jacob Fuest is certain: ""Autonomous driving is a major step towards a future with less road accidents. That's why we work so closely with the automotive industry on removing potential obstacles on the way to a safer future.""

Now online education company Udacity has created an online curriculum that could fundamentally change the way talents are trained and recruited. We spoke to David Silver.

Despite not being old enough to drive, 15-year-old British high school kid Mikel Bober-Irizar is already capable of programming self-driving cars. “He is one of our most successful students,” says David Silver, who is leading the program on how to become a self-driving car engineer. Although a high performer among his fellow students, Mikel has yet to see a lecture hall from the inside. He is currently studying from home – online.  
 
Mikel’s case is pretty remarkable, which makes sense considering he is part of a remarkable project – one that epitomizes the car industry’s rapidly increasing demand for software engineers. Be it large OEMs, suppliers or mobility providers like Uber or Lyft, they are all targeting the small pool of talents with programming skills for self-driving cars. And that’s not all: they are also competing with Google, Microsoft, Amazon and countless other companies that are searching for robotics specialists.
 
 
SEARCHING FOR NEW WAYS TO RECRUIT TALENT
At the same time, universities are unable to meet the ever-growing demand. This is why OEMs are acquiring start-ups for unprecedented sums. Or why Uber took on almost all of Carnegie Mellon University’s robotics faculty to launch its autonomous car program. In this contested environment, automotive players are looking for new ways to train and recruit talent. One of them is Udacity’s Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program, a fee-based online credential. Its promise is certainly intriguing: become a driverless car engineer online – in just nine months!

Udacity is an online education company that offers courses accessible to interested people around the world.  The company is the brainchild of German scientist Sebastian Thrun, an autonomous driving pioneer who won the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 and initiated Google’s self-driving car unit. Udacity’s mission is to democratize education through its sophisticated fee-based Nanodegree programs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning as well as web and mobile development. It was only a question of time until Udacity would also put a focus on driverless cars – and this is where David Silver came into play.
 
Silver, a Princeton computer scientist with a Stanford MBA, smiles a lot when he talks about his passion for driverless cars. “They are going to change the world in ways we can’t even imagine,” he says, “I’m really excited to see how it makes the world a better place.” Embracing typical Silicon Valley values, Silver shows a deep-seated belief in technological progress combined with a hands-on mentality: if you want to change the world, just do it! Having worked in various software and consulting jobs, he started enrolling in free online courses at Udacity in 2015. “There were courses related to automotive topics or robotics, but no specific one on self-driving cars yet. It was all kind of a mishmash, not very well organized,” says Silver. He started writing about his experiences in his blog. Then, one day, Silver received a mail from Sebastian Thrun. “He said: Why don’t you come over to Udacity and put together a course on autonomous vehicles that helps people get hired into the industry?”
 
 
A “FLYER” THAT TURNED INTO A HIT
According to Silver, the Nanodegree program started as what he refers to as a “flyer”. “We just wanted to see if there is interest in this.” When the course was launched in October 2016, the response was overwhelming: more than 15,000 people applied for just 250 slots. Udacity quickly increased the size of the cohort to 500 students, with a new one starting every month. “Our goal is to democratize education so we want to teach as many people as possible,” says Silver.
 
Can anyone now become a self-driving car engineer? Well, in theory yes. “We don’t require our students to have a university degree – but many of our students have master’s degrees, PhDs or are even professors,” says Silver. Degree or not, there are several prerequisites that applicants need to fulfill: this includes an intermediate programming ability as well as basic knowledge in physics, algebra and calculus. Many students therefore come from technical fields like computer science, automotive or electric engineering. However, all career changers also get a chance: “The other day I read a review from an accountant who is taking the program. He said it’s tough, but he’s enjoying it,” says Silver laughing.

Tough – that is an assessment that Silver can subscribe to. “It’s time-consuming. Our students on average spend 20 hours a week on the courses. Most of them are doing it on top of their full time jobs.” The nine-month course is divided into three terms. Each term has a tuition fee of 800 U.S. dollars and consists of various video lessons on specific areas of autonomous driving – be it deep learning, sensor fusion or path planning. To pass each term, the students need to master project tasks. For instance, writing a program that detects highway lanes on a video stream. Or using sensor data to build a map of a car’s environment.
 
But how do students get practical skills? “Those are in fact very practical skills,” Silver says slightly amused. “One thing that surprises many people: most of the work for autonomous vehicles is done on a computer.” This means you don’t need to be physically near the car you are programming. Still, at the end of the program, students will have the chance to test their codes on a self-driving car at Udacity – giving them immediate feedback on how their algorithms work on the road.
 
 


COMPANIES ARE EMBRACING UDACITY
The industry seems nothing short of thrilled by the program. Udacity works with renowned companies like Mercedes, BMW, Nvidia and Continental’s Elektrobit, referred to as “hiring partners” that fast track Udacity graduates for job consideration at their companies. By working together with companies in some of the lessons, Udacity students also gain access to an extended job board. If students indicate interest in a position with a hiring partner, Udacity connects them with the companies. But Silver is quick to emphasize that this does not mean exclusive access to the talents: “Our goal is to get our students hired into the industry. We definitely encourage our students to apply for a job if they are excited about it – whether it’s at a hiring partner or somewhere else.”
 
And the plan works. Although the first cohort of the program will only finish in September, many students were already hired by large companies at the beginning of their studies. Their efforts during the program will be rewarded: according to Udacity, self-driving car engineers can currently earn up to 265,000 U.S. dollars a year. Will Mikel Bober-Irizar be one of them? It’s possible. But it doesn’t seem like he is in it for the money. As he told Automotive News recently: “I want to do something that helps the world.”

Time to do almost anything while on the road. But how will people use that newly gained freedom? A recent survey asked just that – and it is quite telling to see what activities we desire the most!

Imagine it’s the year 2025. You have just pulled your car onto the highway. Now is a good time to switch into self-driving mode. Your steering wheel retracts and you make yourself comfortable. Now what? This is one of the most interesting questions about automated driving in our future society: If people no longer have to control their vehicles, what will they do with their gained time?
 
In 2015, the College of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, published a survey which asked this very question. The answers are a reflection of our contemporary society. Interestingly enough, males and females chose the same number one – with 59 percent each.
 
 


10. SHOOT AND POST PHOTOS OR SELFIES
A quick Google search proves that even in conventional 2015 cars, shooting selfies seems to be a wildly popular activity. How awesome would it be if you could turn your car ride into a photo session while not endangering your fellow road users by being distracted?
 
 
9. PLAN A TRIP





      Photo: Volvo
    



Remember the days when you would plan a trip in advance of hitting the road? In a connected, autonomous vehicle, that will not be necessary anymore. Just get into the car and proclaim your destination. You can take care of the details while on the road. If you do not know where you want to go yet, your car will probably provide you with some useful suggestions – and pick the fastest or most scenic route to get there.
 
 


8. PUT ON MAKEUP
That’s right, women (or men, for that matter) who normally wear makeup might now leave the house without it – that’s what they will use the car ride for. Depending on makeup habits, this could mean 15 (or 30? 60?) more minutes sleep in the morning.
 
 


7. PLAY VIDEO GAMES
Playing Grand Theft Auto in an actual auto: an appealing thought to young adults. According to the study, people aged 18 to 35 are especially keen on playing video games while being chauffeured. This comes as good news for the gaming industry which is already hoping to increase business.
 
 


6. PAY BILLS
Unfortunately, even the most progressive driverless vehicle will not spare you the hassle of paying your bills. However, you will at least have more time for your personal accounting – something many people apparently would appreciate.
 
 
5. DO WORK

Do you waste time every day driving to and from work? Autonomous driving has the potential to make car rides much more productive by turning vehicles into rolling offices. For many businesspeople, this day cannot come soon enough.
 
 
4. WATCH MOVIES

While driverless cars could be used as mobile offices, they could just as easily become living spaces. Just take carmaker Ford: the US company has already issued a patent for a self-driving vehicle that would essentially be a rolling movie theater.
 
 


3. READ A BOOK
Yes, your future car will have all those flashy displays and offer a large variety of on-board entertainment. But it’s not only about the digital advantages. Many people are looking forward to quite an analog pleasure: relaxing with a good book.
 
 


2. EAT LUNCH
It’s a well-deserved second place: eating in the car is an integral part of our modern culture. But directing that sandwich into your mouth while steering and shifting gears at the same time can be quite a challenge. Driverless cars will help you focus on what’s really important: peacefully enjoying your lunch – while your car does all the work.
 
 
1. USE MOBILE DEVICES





      Photo: Volvo
    



You’re not surprised, are you? Chances are, you have already felt the urgent need to look at your smartphone while driving. At any given daylight moment across the USA, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or electronic devices while behind the wheel. This distraction can have serious consequences: one in four car crashes involves drivers texting and talking on cell phones. So autonomous driving will finally give passengers what they really want: more time with their smartphones without being a safety risk.

Think of Birmingham, and chances are you think of bustling city streets and shopping centres, an eclectic and colourful nightlife, or perhaps a legacy in industry. But soon, Birmingham will be at the forefront of what the UK is making possible with driverless infrastructure, and will inspire some very different paths of thought. 
 
It’s the UK’s second city, with the wider metropolitan area being where 3.8 million people – nearly 6 per cent of the entire UK population – call home. In 2017, the city itself had 1.1 million inhabitants, with a projected increase of 500,000 expected by 2021. And a city this big plays host to a lot of cars: 1.79 million to be exact. It’s also a popular city for commuting workers too, with over 166,000 coming in from the surrounding areas.
 
Needless to say, transport is essential to the dynamics of such a place, and it’s investing heavily. It has an extensive metro network, a newly developed major rail station now known as Grand Central, and cycle routes. It’s also gearing up to take on driverless technology. The initiative Midlands Future Mobility has been awarded a new £11 million programme to evaluate connected and autonomous vehicles which will impact on the city enormously. 
 
But what do the young people of Birmingham think of the city’s plans to go driverless? We take to the trendy streets of the iconic Digbeth to find out.
 
 
HEY, MIKE!
Mike, 29, social media executive: Birmingham is a proactive city, and not afraid to do things differently. It invests in growing with the times. It stays current and offers a lot. It pushes the boundaries. I think having automated car systems would integrate very well in Birmingham’s existing developments, such as the new metro. There would be less emissions too, which means the city would be greener.
 
Having a driverless car, which I definitely would, could give me the opportunity to make better use of my commuting time. If it could pick people up for me that’d save time too.
 
 
HEY TANYA!
Tanya, late 20s, runs a vintage clothing shop: If I did drive, I would get home much faster than I do now. I rely on buses and trains, which means two hours of my day are taken up with travelling. It's difficult to get that work-life balance right now. If I could get back just half-an-hour, I'd have more time for me. Driverless cars would make a huge difference. I'd get home sooner, and I'd still be able to chill out and read on my commute.
 
I feel that, if you were going to have driverless cars, all cars would have to be driverless. Road journeys are not set in stone. They are not predictable. Driverless buses, for example, could feel really scary if there were normal cars on the road too.

HEY DANIEL!
Daniel, 19, chef: For someone who does a lot of work, they could benefit from driverless cars, by getting more work done as they travel like they would on trains. However, I'm not sure they're completely safe.
 
I probably wouldn’t leave kids in the cars unsupervised, for example. If I had a kid, I would want to be in the car too. Someone could even hack into the car and take the kid. There's always that one person that finds that way into the system, it doesn’t matter how secure it is.
 
 
HEY EOGHAN!
Eoghan, late 20s, the Brewdog brewery: Driverless cars should make the roads much safer. If you look at any other industry that has a human-tech crossover, you'll find that it does. Even in brewing! Our main brewery is all computer controlled and there are no mess-ups. I think you get more accidents with human error rather than computer error.
 
It could make social stuff more inclusive too. For those groups who want to come out and have a few drinks, chances are they have a designated driver who can't fully enjoy the night with the rest of them. Driverless cars would cancel that out, and everyone would get home safely without overspending on taxis.
 
 
HEY ELLIE!
Ellie, 19, student: If I had a driveress car, I'd be in it all the time. I would go to all sorts of places and I'd do more stuff. I'm getting tired sitting at home, doing nothing, because I haven’t got a car – and I hate buses! I could even get changed in the back without worrying about the wheel.
 
Would I miss driving? Yes and no. I mean, I love manual driving. But auto is better than manual for certain kinds of journeys. Although, its effect on Birmingham might be a bad one. If everyone has one, the roads will be more rammed and nobody will be able to get around very fast.
 
 
HEY KIERAN!
Kieran, 22, graphic design student: I would love getting into a driverless car at the end of a night out, but that’s because I like quite futuristic things. I imagine safety that will be the main thing that people worry about, especially the older generations. They probably won't get it.
 
I'd also worry that driverless technology would bring most people to their phones, kind of halfway to the film Wall-E. People who normally walk to work would be getting these little pods instead, so that is less exercise and less engagement with the world. They will just be in this little pod, and won't see anything that is going on with the world unless it's on their phone screen.
 
 

HEY LUKE!
Luke, 25, proofreader: I've mostly seen driverless as a thing of the distant future. But, if they were to become reality, I would be able to find more time to do the things I love to do, such as write. Similar to the way I can do my work on the train or bus, I could focus solely on my work whilst still travelling directly from A to B.
 
I think I'd miss 'normal' driving, though. It's quite nice to go for short drives at night. It helps me wind down, when the roads are empty and you can just go at your own speed. Saying that, I think the perks of having a driverless car would outweigh this.

According to the young people of Digbeth, driverless cars will offer the people of Birmingham countless opportunities in terms of time and money saving, and even more for adventure. For some, it could completely change the way they live their lives. But the jury seems to be out as to whether a driverless city will be safer, and there are even deeper fears about further reliance on technology for public autonomy.
 
Safety and overreliance on technology – is this a universal fear shared by young and old alike? Join the conversation and let us know your thoughts.

In 2015, Japan amazed the world by saying that self-driving cars – including fleets of driverless taxis – would play a big part in their hosting of the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic games. With Tokyo 2020 just 16 months away, how close are they to making that a reality, and what will it mean for Japan if they pull it off?
 
 
THE SHINKANSEN LEGACY

By the opening ceremony in 2020, it will have been 56 years since Tokyo last played host to the Olympic games. In a bid to show the world how far it had come since it was devastated by World War II, and to start the 1964 Olympics with a bold statement, Japan unveiled the Shinkansen. This was the world's first high-speed train, which became colloquially known as the 'bullet train'.
 
The Shinkansen was slick, state-of-the-art and it symbolised a whole new era of transport for both Japan and the world. It went on to form a benchmark for other high-speed railways, with the same technology being used all over the world, from China to the UK. In fact, it's still influencing high-speed rail to this very day.
 
Keeping with tradition, Japan plans on making a similarly bold statement about the future of national and global transport technology in 2020. They will do this by making driverless cars a key feature in their second hosting of the Olympic games. Or, at least, that's the plan.
 
 
ENTER: MR ABE
In October 2015, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzō Abe was feeling pretty confident about this ambitious goal: “I can tell you that in 2020 Tokyo, self-driving cars will be running around, and you will be able to use them to move around,” he remarked during that year's annual meeting of the Science and Technology in Society (STS) forum.
 
Mr Abe had experienced driverless technology himself a few years prior to making these remarks, as he had completed several high-profile test drives in autonomous cars in 2013. This was all part of a much bigger plan by Abe, who took office in 2012, to boost the Japanese economy by promoting new technology and changing the legislation around its use.
 
Progress since then has been slow but steady, with Japanese brands Toyota, Honda and, most recently, Hitachi taking part in creating economy-boosting autonomous tech. Tokyo envisioned both the athletes and the spectators benefitting from driverless transportation for the Olympics inside and around the village, the arena and even in the city of Tokyo.

HOW CLOSE ARE THEY?
Toyota are planning on providing their driverless e-Palette cars to transport competitors around the athlete's village as part of a 3,000 strong fleet. This will be alongside two different types of new 'fuel cell' vehicles powered by a chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen. The driverless e-Palette, which was conceptually unveiled in January 2018, will be fully electric, shaped like a cube and minus a driver's seat and steering wheel – or any manual controls at all.
 
That may well be the athletes and other partaking members of the games covered, but what about the spectators? Well, in July 2018, a month-long driverless experiment began with city road tests for self-driving pay-as-you-go taxis made by ZMP, a developer of driverless technology and a rival to Toyota and Uber.
 
1,500 people signed up to give the driverless minivan a spin, with 96 chosen to order the vehicle via their smartphones and pay 1,500 yen (13,41 USD) for a one-way trip through the busy streets of Tokyo. The terms of the road tests meant that a driver and an assistant were present at all times to take over if required, but the experiment ended in August without any major incidents.
 
The success of this experiment, with others planned in the coming year, bodes very well for Tokyo's hopes for making driverless mobility a possibility by the opening ceremony. But once the final medals have been awarded and the torch has been passed to Beijing for 2022, what will Tokyo do with their new driverless tech and infrastructure?
 
 
THE LONG GAME
The Olympics is both a rollout deadline, and a large-scale road test. The Japanese government fully intends to commercialise the driverless system as early as 2022 – tying into a big, overarching innovation strategy which includes plans for virtual power plants and various artificial intelligence technologies.
 
Aside from keeping Japan at the forefront of innovation and technological advancement on the global stage, there are ulterior motives to this push for driverless progress. With an ageing and declining workforce, as well as sluggish economic growth, Japanese companies have struggled to keep up with their Chinese, European and U.S. counterparts in a number of different ways. But that could be set to change.

The commercialisation of driverless technology, starting with the 2020 Olympic Games, is just the beginning. With radical new autonomous technologies being so heavily promoted, and new legislation being created to make it easier for businesses to use it, Japan could well be setting a brand-new benchmark for transport technology in 2020 – for the second time in a row.

Driverless car technology invites countless opportunity for everyone. But it would seem working parents will enjoy more benefits than most, as they take back valuable quality time with their children. Time which could be used in all sorts of interesting and productive ways.
 
There are few who know more about the interesting and productive ways to spend time with children than those who follow the Montessori education method. Here's the driverless story, as told by Montessori. 
 
 
WHAT IS 'MONTESSORI'?
Montessori is an alternative method of education. Its schools have a holistic approach to learning that is completely child-centred and built around the belief that each child is an individual with their own unique 'gifts'. Therefore, it is the pupils, not the teachers, who determine what they will learn and, to an extent, how. Their highly trained teacher, or 'Directress', facilitates their chosen direction of learning through structured activities and games.
 
In effect, Montessori is all about learning through play.
 
The Montessori philosophy is one which determines that learning doesn't just take place in a classroom, and it doesn't stop at 'education' either. It works to develop the 'whole child': physically, socially, emotionally and cognitively; looking to the greater world as an extension of the classroom, with countless opportunities for learning.
 
No doubt, driverless car technology allowing for more parent-child time during the school run may well support the Montessori education. After all, driverless lends itself nicely to opportunities for further educational development outside the classroom and encourages extra parental bonding at a time when parent-child quality time is vanishing.
 
 
ASK THE PARENTS
We recently spoke to several working parents about some of the tricks they currently employ – from bribery to revised leaving times – in order to encourage their kids to cooperate in cars. We also spoke to them about the difference having a driverless car would make to that experience. 
 
The responses were encouraging. Some talked about using the time productively, such as polishing off tasks for school and reading, and others were simply happy to get back some 'quality time'. After all, when all parents work, quality parent-child time is a rare commodity.
 
But what about the Montessori perspective? Can driverless car technology better the lives of their pupils? We spoke to Raju Surelia, a Montessori Head Teacher, to find out.
 
 
ASK THE TEACHER
Raju has been the headteacher at Little Learners School in Solihull, England, for 24 years. She believes mornings are particularly important to her pupils, of whom are aged between two and four. Some travel up to an hour to get to school and, even though most children arrive rested and ready for a day's learning, some will arrive a little stressed from the journey. And if the children are stressed, you can only imagine how the parents feel.

“I feel the level of stress would be much lower all-round if parents had quality time with their children in the mornings. The journey in a driverless car would certainly provide this opportunity. I can see parents investing in it.""
 
Echoing the sentiments of the parents interviewed for the 'confessions of a working parent' film, Raju acknowledges that driverless car technology will have untold benefits for working parents, especially when their children are young. 
 
""There's another teacher here who has two young children. I spoke to her about this. She said it would be 'just bliss', being able to talk to her children, and just 'be there'.”
 
However, the free time driverless cars offer parents should not necessarily be used to proactively start their learning on the way to school, especially when they're young. But that perspective changes when the children start having more responsibility at school.
 
“Parents are so stressed nowadays. Just spending quality time with their child would be fabulous. However, as they get older, maybe doing their homework would help. Our parents are often genuinely interested in their children’s learning, so I think they would use the time not driving productively.”
 
Parent-child 'quality time', whatever form that may take, is well-documented as having untold benefits in wellbeing, resulting in better behaviour, better mental and emotional health and even better physical health.

If we take the children at Raju's school as an example, up to an hour twice a day of focused time between a parent and their child is the kind of time that would be hard to find elsewhere for busy working parents.
 
And, depending on what parents decide to do during that time, there could be other benefits too. An improvement in communication for example, or increased socialisation if parents maintain that time in the car is also time away from screens.
 
Even if that time is simply used to simply chat together, rather than undertaking a specific activity, the parental bonding benefits alone would be worth an investment in driverless technology.

Those who can’t drive themselves are very much aware of the development of driverless cars, and of course they’re excited about what it means for them. But people with disabilities also wish for reasonable prospects and their individual needs to be taken into consideration early on.
 
It’s a complex topic, with multiple considerations. Today, we take a closer look at some of the key points in the debate.
 
 


WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
The conversation regarding driverless cars and disability began in November 2016 with an interview with UK transport consultant James Welling, who has celebral palsy.
 
This interview, which discussed the impact of driverless technology on people with disabilities, triggered a multi-channel discussion from which two new arguments arose. But before we get into those, it’s important we understand the situation as it stands.
 
 


THE STATE OF PLAY IN THE UK
To put things into perspective, there are around 65 million people living in the UK, of which over 11 million share a limiting long-term illness, impairment or disability. That's roughly one in five British citizens. 
According to a UK government survey from 2014, the most commonly-reported impairments are those that affect mobility. The same survey states that around a fifth of disabled people report experiencing difficulties related to their impairment or disability in accessing and using transport. 
These are facts that James Welling is very much aware of, something he alludes to in his original interview.
 
 


BACK TO THE CONVERSATION
The first conclusion from the original article determined that, in contrast to the general audience for driverless tech, people with disabilities often absolutely depend on being ‘driven around’ in some way, and have been closely following the public conversation on the development of automated driving from the very start.
 
This group can, and has, offered some strong and often surprising views on the topic. Driverless isn’t just feature that will make their daily life more convenient, it could also be an immediate gamechanger for their entire way of living.

THE ARGUMENTS FOR DRIVERLESS CARS – FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF DISABILITY
The key points from the discussion surrounding the original article can be summarised as:
 

Disabled people can own or share a vehicle without having to rely on special service
Self-driving cars will not replace the ‘human function’ that people with disabilities depend on

 
But what does this mean for us? Let's take a closer look.
 
 


1. DISABLED PEOPLE CAN OWN OR SHARE A VEHICLE WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY ON SPECIAL SERVICES
Today, most people with disabilities such as these get around either via public transportation or by using assigned driving services, but these means of transit often hold their own set of challenges for disabled users.
 
In his interview, James Welling points out that he lived “in a small village far off the main road” in his youth, always needing someone to give him a lift into the nearest town. This left him feeling “quite isolated”. While Welling does have positive things to say about the current transport situation for the disabled in the UK, his basic stance on the subject is: “right now, we are going backwards” by not investing in infrastructure and removing personnel in this important public sector.
 
This is where the main benefit of self-driving cars for people with disabilities comes in. Driverless vehicles will automatically result in more accessible and more comfortable transit for all involved, without the need for third party intervention at any level. It could be cheaper too, with multiple riders having the option to share one vehicle.
 
But, as with all solutions to any complex problem, it isn't perfect.
 
 

2. SELF-DRIVING CARS WILL NOT REPLACE THE ‘HUMAN FUNCTION’ THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES DEPEND ON
Disabilities are as individual as the people who live with them, and all of these people have their own set of specific needs besides the missing capability to drive.
 
One example, that was brought into the discussion by a commenter on the original article, are traumatic brain injuries, or TBIs, which occur with veterans “as well as [being] the leading severe injury from auto accidents, a product of strokes, and other injuries."" TBIs can often disrupt visual processing, which means the eyes themselves 'work', but the person cannot correctly process what they see.
 
People with disabilities can need all kinds of assistance – services that today are often provided by unsung heroes, as stated in the discussion: “the taxi driver who does this daily is not recognised, nor is the bus driver or transit system guard.”
 
Another participant in the discussion stated: “some people will always need carers to get them in and out of the [vehicle] and even travel with them. It will mean that they (and society if we subsidise the cost, as we should) will have to pay to have a person to still perform the human functions that drivers now perform.”
 
All concerns raised about people needing personal support are important in understanding that the technology is not going to 'take over' completely. There is also our own argument that people with disabilities are in danger of being less socially active, and the removal of the interactions that occur during transit could lead to further isolation in some cases. But to counter this, driverless tech could provide easier access to friends, family and events, which could make up for the shortfall.
 
Evidently, the 'human function' cannot be dismissed for this group, and it should never be suggested that it will. Therefore, it's important not to portray automated driving as the cure-all for every problem that people with disabilities face when travelling. Instead, solutions that maintain that crucial human factor must be prioritised.

THE BOTTOM LINE
For people with disabilities, the threshold to embrace automated driving is much lower than it is for the general population. However, while generally positive about driverless technology, the group remains skeptical of the promises that are often attached to the topic. After all, there are some very high expectations on driverless technology and what it will mean for people with disabilities, but some big challenges to overcome before it becomes a reality.
 
A continuous dialogue with this group is pivotal as, even when these expectations have been met, new ones will undoubtedly surface. But we have to meet the initial expectations first, which may take time.
 
In his original interview James summarised this problem of raising hopes within the disabled community:
""It’s comparable to the media hyping that there might be a cure for all cancers soon. I find it highly irresponsible. We’ve all got a responsibility to be as realistic as possible.""
 
 


LET'S KEEP TALKING
Mobility and driverless technology is set to be a big topic in the coming months and years, and it is a subject we intend to keep talking about. To do that, we need you. Your opinions, your experiences and your knowledge. We will keep this conversation going on social media too. See the links below to connect.
Join the debate, and help us influence the way the world looks at driverless technology and disability.

Recap
what3words is a simple way of navigating to a very precise location, swapping complicated grid references like GPS coordinates for three random words. These words are the decoded using an app, giving the location down to 3 x 3m squares – less exact than GPS but often way better than just a street address. It is designed for a variety of applications, from emergency response to navigation and delivery in areas with limited postal information.
 
However, it isn’t easily understandable for everyday use by humans. For example, your location could be “tree.dog.house”, which is nonsense to a person, but makes perfect sense to a computer with the correct decoding software, which can then be displayed on a map for humans to understand. This makes what3words very much a tech-oriented way of navigating.

Is anyone using what3words yet?
Car manufacturers certainly seem to have seen the precision benefits that what3words offers. Indian and Chinese carmakers Tata Motors and WM Motors are now beginning to incorporate the system into car navigation technologies, while Ford and Mercedes Benz have already been using the app for some time.  
 
Vitally, it is the options this brings for voice command that seems most appealing to drivers. As what3words founder Chris Sheldrick says, “We have increasingly come to expect a level of connectivity and services that matches our smartphone’s and home voice assistant levels of accuracy.” Chief Marketing Officer Giles Rhys Jones agrees: “It’s a perfect solution for drone deliveries and autonomous vehicles” 
 
It is true that, as Giles explained, “an autonomous vehicle will need an incredibly precise location to know where to end its journey, far more so than a street address allows,"" but why would an autonomous vehicle use what3words over GPS co-ordinates which could be easily programmed and understood the computer-powered car?
 
The answer to this is simple – humans. Though many journeys could be made without direction, or using stored locations, humans will still need a way to accurately convey a new, precise, destination to driverless cars of the future.  
 
And for this, what3words has proved incredibly useful. Three-word addresses are 25% faster to enter by voice than street addresses and can now be entered in 35 languages. Emmanuele Spera, CEO and co-founder of Next Future Transportation, is convinced of its benefits. “what3words is fundamental for driverless cars to be a success,” he says, “you can’t call a driverless car and explain where the precise entrance to your apartment block is.” Similarly, you can’t explain to an AV where you are waiting for collection if it’s arrived at the wrong spot. Precise communication is needed for a driverless future to become our reality, and though autonomous vehicles could handle GPS co-ordinates, humans cannot. 
 
As predicted by Giles last year, what3words is also having a huge impact on our emergency services across the globe. There are now 100 UK emergency services using the app as an aid to finding people in crisis and it has already been successfully used to send paramedics to precise spots and narrow down the scope of rescue operations.

Have any what3words competitors emerged?
Absolutely. The What Free Words website, an attempt by disgruntled anonymous developers to make potentially life-saving system open-source, emerged earlier this year, but has since been taken down. However, the fact remains that the criticism remains. If what3words or a copycat alternative that isn’t instantly shut down by legal eagles were to become fully open source, then it becomes a more attractive proposition for OEMs and driverless tech developers. 
 
Then there’s Plus Codes. Google thought what3words was a good idea, so they silently rolled out this alternative form of location sharing into Google Maps. There are a few differences, for example with the code format, which consists of six random letters broken into two components, but the big challenge to the what3words crown is the fact that Plus Codes is completely open source – no ownerships, no limits, and no exclusivity, meaning it can be used online or even printed out and fixed in remote locations for users without internet access. 
 
On a more humorous note, the what3words system has been parodied by other developers using the same concept and OpenMaps grids, but with more ‘select’ word choices. what3f*** ensures that only profanities can be used to give a location (and has been since closed down by a legal response), and what3emojis does the same, replacing words with the small pictures we’re used to seeing on our phones.

Will what3words have an impact on driverless cars in the future?
It is clear that what3words makes communicating a precise location a straightforward task, and that it could prove useful in autonomous vehicles of all kinds, but is there another way? As we are all increasingly connected and are so rarely beyond reach of either our own devices or others which can monitor our location, we must ask whether using such an app to pinpoint our own, or any other, location will be necessary for much longer.  
 
We already share so much data in relation to our location (just think, how many retailers, delivery services and other organisations have you shared your address with?) that it doesn’t seem too farfetched to think our location could be monitored without us actually having to share it afresh through systems such as what3words. If you’re a Google user, your location is pretty much known at all times anyway. Couldn’t we simply order a car to ‘home’ and ask it to take us to ‘work’ without having to specify the address of either place?  
 
We could even give our cars the option to choose for us. For example, ‘take me to a pizza restaurant’ could mean the car has decide between the highest rated pizza place in town, the one we visit most, or the cheapest one if our bank account is linked to the car’s AI! 
 
Either way, for now, and a year on from our chat with Giles, it seems that what3words could present some exciting opportunities for automation. The company’s goal, as Giles said, “for everyone to use their three-word address anywhere you’d enter a traditional address” certainly hasn’t been achieved yet, and the concept of humans even having to think about where they’re actually going could be taken out of our hands if our cars are smart enough. 
 
 
Navigation has been thought of as a complex hurdle – until what3words that is. So, what other assumptions about AVs might be wrong? Find out in 5 driverless myths debunked.

In the first part of our interview, they reveal why self-driving cars will have regional characteristics – and how their usage in Shanghai and USA will differ.

When Ralph Lauxmann and Ibro Muharemovic discuss automated driving, you can expect a pretty intense conversation – mixed with a lot of laughter. Both high ranking Continental engineers, you can sense that their job is their passion. We brought Muharemovic, who heads Continental’s Cruising Chauffeur Project, and Lauxmann, Senior Vice President Engineering, together for what turned out to be a very intriguing talk.
 
2025AD: Lately, carmakers seem to strive to outbid each other in setting earlier release dates for fully automated driving technology. Was there a leap in the development or are we simply experiencing intensified marketing efforts?
Lauxmann: There has been a technological leap indeed – and it’s important to communicate this progress to consumers. Intense competition has pushed the development of components and vehicles to the extent that series production of higher levels of automation is now foreseeable. But vehicle technology is only one important element: we also need a legal framework and the right infrastructure. Each of these three parts is crucial. They need to interact.
 
2025AD: How do you assess the current state of lawmaking efforts then?
Lauxmann: The legal discussion is very technology focused at the moment. It would make more sense to create a framework that leaves room for different technological solutions. For instance, we see legal guidelines that deal with the radar sensors that are installed in cars to detect tailgating and initiate a lane change. We should avoid narrow definitions that only allow for one specific technological approach. Why not define minimum requirements as to what an automated car needs to be able to do – and leave the design to the industry.
 
2025AD: It seems the U.S. administration is following more of a “laissez-faire” approach.
Muharemovic: I don’t think so. If they did then we’d have to change our set up every time we cross the state line. Thankfully, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is currently working to streamline legislation. (ed.note: for more information, see here) For the car industry, it’s really important that laws don’t become too granular. We need to have a set-up we can use in all 50 states.

2025AD: Speaking of different approaches - are there cultural differences when it comes to the acceptance of automated driving? Are U.S. Americans more open to the technology than Europeans are?
Muharemovic: We live in a globalized world so I don’t believe cultural differences still play an important role. It’s more interesting to look at the different groups you find in every culture. There are tech freaks and early adopters in Germany, USA or Japan. There are also differences among age groups. When I grew up, I always wanted to drive a V8 Mustang. I’m a typical gearhead. My brother is nine years younger and he wants to be driven. If he can summon a level 4 vehicle with his smartphone – that’s okay for him. Lauxmann: It won’t be enough to find a business case that only appeals to tech freaks. To reduce accidents significantly, the key will be developing a technology with benefits for all user groups.
 
2025AD: Will there be one global approach for automated driving? Or will we need regional variations?
Muharemovic: We will need to have a common understanding everywhere as to what automated driving offers. But of course, traffic in Michigan is different from traffic in Frankfurt: the speed, the rules, the behaviors – like how drivers change lanes for example!

2025AD: So it’s about different driving styles?
Lauxmann: The systems must be designed to cope with regional characteristics, like left-hand traffic. The elevated highways in Japan are a huge challenge for sensors. Even in Downtown Chicago, you sometimes don’t have reception with your smartphone. So vehicles and infrastructure always need to be adapted. But we need to define the car’s functions for individual use cases – and the handling of those use cases should be the same in every vehicle.
 
2025AD: Can you give an example?
Lauxmann: If I rent a car in the USA or anywhere in the world today, the means by which you activate Adaptive Cruise Control for example, differs in every vehicle. Say I want a car to drive me automatically from A to B – I should not have to study the manual for half an hour first to see how to activate this function. A standardized definition of those use cases will be crucial to create trust in the technology. If it’s a button that will activate automated driving, I would prefer that process to be the same, no matter what kind of vehicle I am sitting in.

2025AD: But will carmakers still be able to set themselves apart from competitors if a certain level of standardization is essential?
Muharemovic: Essentially, the cars’ DNA will be the same. Safety critical features have to be designed in such a way that users can instantly get along with them should they switch their car. In our globalized world, we are already seeing this development. The icon for windshield wipers is the same everywhere around the world. We also need icons for automated driving use cases – and the use cases have to be the same in each car… Lauxmann: …but there will be countless ways of customizing a fully automated car. How a car accelerates, how it takes a curve, how the interior and lighting are designed: there is still so much potential for carmakers to differentiate themselves and appeal to their customers.
 
2025AD: What do you consider as the most important use cases?
Lauxmann: Highly automated vehicles will basically have three applications. First, they can take me from A to B on a highway. Second, they can transport goods or people in urban traffic. And third, they can park autonomously. The degree of utilization will vary in different regions. In the USA, the highway pilot will certainly play a huge role because of the large distance between cities. But with valet parking I’m not so sure. It’s already an established model there in its truest sense: people park your car for you. You also have giant parking lots in front of malls so the need for automation might be less compelling than in Shanghai where parking lots are scarce. So based on the technology, different regions will have different priorities – but we won’t design functions specifically for a region.
 


In the second part of our interview, Ralph Lauxmann and Ibro Muharemovic will discuss the Human-Machine-Interface – and how automated and conventional cars can coexist safely. We will publish it in January. Stay tuned!

DEMOLITION MAN (1993, SET IN 2032)






Play








025 AD: We found Demolition Man to be quite an astonishing movie in that it predicted self-driving cars quite accurately in 1993. Would you agree?
 
Hohm: There are several remarkable aspects about this movie, starting with the appearance of the vehicles. They all look pretty similar and provide less emotionality than automobiles on our roads today. This leads to a fundamental question: will the cars of the future just be tools to get from A to B? In my opinion, there will still be a huge demand for cars that help you express a part of your personality. Another remarkable element is the human-machine-interface (HMI) used in those cars, because it is very realistic.
 
2025 AD: When in autonomous mode, the steering wheel contracts, signalizing that the vehicle is driving itself. It expands again when the driver uses the command “self drive on”.
 
Hohm: This is one of the biggest challenges that car manufacturers face: a seamless transition between automated and manual mode. This movie is a nice example for a smooth handover between machine and human. This is a very exciting concept. It still leaves the owner the choice to drive manually or to override the autonomous mode. When we think of the year 2032, I find this to be a realistic prognosis. 
 
2025 AD: The car in Demolition Man uses so-called biolinks. It identifies who is sitting behind the wheel and automatically adjusts the settings. Weight, height and peripheral perception of the driver are taken into account. Can we expect such customization in the cars of the future?
 
Hohm: The movie certainly takes a very extreme stance on this. But it is reasonable to expect some of those elements. The more we know about the driver, the better we can support him. A good example is the technology that detects the attentiveness of the driver and alerts him to potential hazards on the road. This will soon be part of series vehicles. Another possibility is to deploy sensors into the car that recognize characteristics of the driver – and then automatically adjust mirrors, headrests or the seat.
 
2025 AD: Possibly the key to preventing car theft?
 
Hohm: If we can observe weight, height or interocular distance of the driver we can decide if the person behind the wheel is authorized at all to drive the car. It is a plausible scenario that such a function might replace a car key in the future. It obviously raises questions of data protection. But I am sure that we can solve this challenge and ensure that the driver decides who can have access to his data.
 
2025 AD: There’s a scene in the movie where Sylvester Stallone, who comes from the past, insists in a typically macho way that he will drive. When he can’t cope with the modern technology, he admits defeat and Sandra Bullock takes over. Is this in some way telling?
 
Hohm: That is an indication that we will move away from the standardization of vehicles that we know today. Someone who learned to drive a car 30 years ago would still be able to steer a contemporary vehicle without any major problems. That is because we have a high degree of standardization. Brakes and accelerator, gear lever and steering wheel: the basic elements are similar in every vehicle. With automation increasing, that is likely to change. The goal must be that you will still be able to operate every car in the future, therefore the handling must be self-explanatory. Clearly, in Demolition Man the industry has not fully succeeded in this.
 
I, ROBOT (2004, SET IN 2035)






Play








2025 AD: I, Robot is set in the same decade as Demolition Man. Yet the makers of this movie took a different approach on self-driving cars. How do they compare?
 
Hohm: The functionalities are comparable. Just like in Demolition Man, the vehicles here can either drive autonomously or be driven manually. The fundamental difference in I,Robot is that people still have an emotional relationship to those vehicles. The Audi that Will Smith drives is definitely not just a tool to get from A to B. It is a very sportive vehicle with attractive interior.  Those films form the two ends of a spectrum.
 
2025 AD: Yet, in I, Robot the self-driving mode has become the new norm. In one scene, Will Smith horrifies his female co-driver by switching into manual mode on the highway. It seems that, in the movie, society considers manual driving to be reckless while self-driving mode is considered safe. Can you see this shift actually happening?
 
Hohm: I would not rule it out for a very distant future, but I deem it rather unlikely. Interestingly, Tesla’s Elon Musk has predicted that manual driving will eventually be outlawed because it will be considered too dangerous. But in my opinion, there will always be a symbiosis between those two modes. Exclusively relying on autonomous driving does not meet the needs of many drivers to whom driving means much more than the simple transport of people.
 
2025 AD: When it comes to parking, I, Robot showcases a remarkable approach. The driver parks the vehicle in a designated zone. A hatch in the wall opens and the car is automatically sucked into a giant parking garage where cars are being stored vertically – talk about stacking them high! A reality by 2035?
 
Hohm: What we see is a specific form of automated valet parking. It is already technologically possible today to hand over your car to a system which automatically parks the vehicle.  Cars can be parked much closer to each other since no one has to enter or get out of the car. So parking is definitely becoming more space-efficient. Once this technology leaves the experimental stage, we are not too far away from the system shown in the movie. Parking cars vertically is tricky, though. Cars of today are not built for that. In the concrete case, fuel would probably run out of the tank.
 
2025 AD: What are your thoughts on the depiction of Augmented Reality in the movie? In manual mode, it serves to assist the driver, displaying important information onto the windshield – like the speed or distance to the car in front. In self driving mode the windshield turns into an in-car cinema or office! The driver is completely cut off from the events on the road.
 
Hohm: This is a very realistic depiction. A human-machine interface on the windshield is already part of series vehicles today. If we achieve an intuitive HMI to display driver assistance systems, manual driving will be safe and competitive to autonomous driving for a very long time. At the same time, it appears probable that by 2035, we will have scenarios where the passengers can hand over driving entirely to the machine and enjoy on-board entertainment. So it makes sense to use the windshield for both: driver assistance and amusement.
 
MINORITY REPORT (2002, SET IN 2054)






Play









2025 AD: Last but not least: Minority Report. What is striking about this dystopian thriller by Steven Spielberg?
 
Hohm: We experience a radical turn away from the traffic system we know today. Vehicles are no longer owned individually. Instead, they resemble self-driving taxis or shared cars that pick you up right at your door. The system appears to be very efficient and features fascinating approaches like cars moving vertically to get to a desired arterial road. I think this kind of mobility will play a bigger role in the future, but not in this exclusivity. People will still want the vehicle as an individual living space. A place where I can leave personal stuff, where my children’s toys lie ready-to-hand at the backseat.
 
2025 AD: The driverless vehicles in the film move as if by magic.  Presumably they are controlled by some central authority or they organize themselves through some sort of swarm intelligence. Which do you reckon could take off as the autonomous traffic system of the future?
 
Hohm: I think that we will always have a combination of both. We will need a central instance that monitors the big picture: where are the traffic hot spots? how many cars are on the road? how do they have to be distributed to ensure the ideal flow of traffic? This is intelligence that single cars do not have. But vehicles also need to be able to react to certain situations individually, for instance avoiding objects or people that suddenly enter the road. Some intelligence always needs to remain in the car.
 
2025 AD: In the movie, Tom Cruise is trying to escape in a car. But the police have no trouble locating him and even take over remote control of his driverless vehicle, forcing him to jump out of it. Will autonomous driving open up completely new possibilities for law enforcement?
 
Hohm: I am very critical of such an external control because it is seriously interfering with the personal freedoms of drivers. We should not make use of everything that might be technologically feasible. I expect controversial discussions on this topic like we have them today regarding mobile phone data. The driver needs to stay in charge. He decides whether his car runs autonomously or manually. And if he wants to switch off automation entirely, he is free to do so.
 
2025 AD: We’ll let you have the last word: How is Hollywood doing when it comes to automated driving?
 
Hohm: Kudos! I think Hollywood has developed fascinating visions that entertain and at the same time serve as an inspiration for engineers. Watching how creative minds envision the mobility of the future is incredibly exciting

But are its depictions of autonomous vehicles realistic – or just pipe dreams? We asked Andree Hohm, leading engineer at Continental, to do a reality check for us. The results are astonishing.




Cars falling in love or casually chatting with their driver – Hollywood lets its imagination run wild when it comes to self-driving cars. Many of those movies have become very popular. But have they also influenced the way the car industry envisions driverless mobility?
 
Andree Hohm is Head of Lighthouse Program Automated Driving at Continental – and a movie buff at the same time. So with popcorn out and feet up, we sat down to watch some flicks with him. Together we took a closer look at some of the most beloved films depicting future cars and traffic systems. We asked Mr Hohm to evaluate their degree of realism: will these movie dreams one day become reality – or are they already? In the first of two parts, Mr Hohm discusses a VW Beetle with human feelings and a car named KITT that resembles the Tesla Model S in some ways.
 
2025 AD: Many Hollywood movies and TV series feature automated driving. What’s most interesting about them, when watched through the eyes of an expert like yourself?
 
Andree Hohm: As an engineer, you have a step-by-step approach to the development process. A movie that takes place in 2050 frees itself from those small steps and shows how the big jump could look like! Hollywood can imagine the traffic system of the future and implement it right away – regardless of technological hurdles that engineers of today face. That’s fascinating!
 
2025 AD: Hollywood seems t have visionary abilities. Take for instance the communicators used in Star Trek episodes in the 1960s. They resembled modern mobile phones. Is there a mutual influence between Hollywood and the car industry as well? Do engineers really take inspiration from the world of film?
 
Hohm: I think that is the case. Maybe not directly, but rather subconsciously. We have a film industry that globally shapes expectations of how future mobility will develop. So we have similar perceptions on this topic all around the globe. This informs concrete decisions when it comes to developing actual products. Of course, this also works in the other direction: the car industry and mobility research inspire filmmakers as well.
 
2025AD: So, let’s take a look at some movies…
 
HERBIE (FIRST MOVIE RELEASED IN 1969)






Play








2025 AD: Early Hollywood depictions of automated cars show very far-reaching artificial intelligence. Take the much-loved VW Beetle Herbiefor example. Here is a vehicle that lives its own life: it falls in love, gets depressed or even drunk. Cars having feelings and human senses; is that a step too far?
 
Hohm: Movies like Herbie are a reflection of our society’s relation to the car. To many people, the car is more than a machine. They have an intensive, almost intimate relationship to their vehicle. Herbie expands this idea in ascribing human feelings to a car. From an engineer’s point of view, this is interesting – but of course extremely unrealistic. When we talk about artificial intelligence in cars, we think of imitating the human performance when it comes to detecting objects or interpreting complex traffic scenarios. But I do not think we will see machines that have their own free will – and personally I do not think that is desirable, either.
 
THE CAR (1977)






Play








2025 AD: Some movies also show the other extreme. In The Car a presumably self-driving vehicle turns evil and terrorizes a small town.
 
Hohm: That is the logical consequence when you project human characteristics into the car. Just like there are good people, there are evil people. The vehicle represents the complete spectrum of human attributes.
 
KNIGHT RIDER (1982-1986)






Play








2025 AD: Knight Rider became an instant classic in the 1980s. How close to reality is KITT, the self-aware, self-driving car of the show’s star, David Hasselhoff?
 
Hohm: KITT is a more realistic car than Herbie, for instance, and has features that we will likely experience in the vehicles of the future! KITT is capable of solving complex problems independentlyMichael Knight, played by Hasselhoff, is instructing the vehicle through voice control. That is something we already see partly in today’s series vehicles.
 
2025 AD: Michael Knight is not only talking to KITT – but the two have a rapport and they interact with each other. A model for our future cars?
 
Hohm: Bidirectional communication is already possible in today’s vehicles, but that is – admittedly – rather one-dimensional. The driver voices his instructions and if the car has trouble processing this order, it can pose a query. That is within the realms of possibility. But I do not think that we want actual conversations with our cars like Michael Knight has with KITT. A conversation implies that your dialog partner has a free will. Communication with the car should have a strict separation of duties: there is a driver who commands and a vehicle that executes. 
 
2025 AD: Michael Knight is also able to summon KITT through his smartwatch. Tesla has recently announced a similar feature for its Model S. Will we all feel like David Hasselhoff soon?
 
Hohm: It is likely that this feature will be introduced step-by-step. KITT’s summon feature works regardless of its whereabouts and of the route that the car has to drive to get to its owner. In reality, we will first see this function in more easily controllable environments, like valet parking.  If you want to extend this function to any desired scenario, the requirements become a lot higher. But once cars drive fully autonomously, a summon feature comparable to KITT will be feasible.

During the recent winter games on their home turf in Pyeongchang, the car manufacturer was going for gold – in two disciplines. With a fuel cell and an autopilot system, they want their new Nexo to be the most advanced car in the world.
 

Rob Ewitt is confused. The ice hockey fan only wanted to get a quick ride to the next venue, and now he appears to be taking a trip into the future. The young man from Canada is sitting in one of the five Nexos that Hyundai brought to Pyeongchang to demonstrate the current state of research on automated driving. For two weeks, the unremarkable SUV ferried people between sports venues on a course of about 15 kilometers, traversing roundabouts, mastering pedestrian crossings and bus lanes, stopping at traffic lights and remaining unfazed by fans running across the four-lane road celebrating victories.
 
But even if Ewitt looks at the friendly Hyundai engineer in disbelief as he presses the button usually reserved for cruise control and puts his hands into his lap, the steering wheel turning itself, the journey through the Olympic city is nothing special. Car manufacturers have been demonstrating for years that autopilot systems can master complex situations in city traffic. Even Hyundai. Take their impressive test route through Las Vegas at the 2017 CES, for example. And still, the test driver seems relieved when the Nexo doesn’t make a smooth turn or when it fails to spot an obstacle until the last minute. After all, if everything goes well, nobody would believe him when he says the market introduction of such systems might still take a while.
 

The first automated vehicle with a fuel cell
 
The Nexo is a prototype like no other. The 4.67 meter-long SUV is the first vehicle with both automated driving technology and a fuel cell. ""We are combining two of the most important future trends in our industry in just one car,"" says project leader Sae Hoon Kim, believing each form of technology will enhance the development of the other. Even though the range of a fuel-cell vehicle is far from being as crucial as that of an electric vehicle, given that the Nexo has a range of around 800 kilometers and can be recharged in just a few minutes (rather than hours), autopilot systems are still considered more economical and efficient than any human driver. And as the multitude of sensors and control units for autonomous driving use an average of 1.5 kW of electrical power, it makes sense to have your own power station on board.

Unlike the LIDAR sensors discretely installed on the front, sides and rear of the Nexo, or the high-resolution stereo camera behind the windscreen, the drivetrain is no longer a one-off. It will now be mass produced – something that Kim is particularly pleased about. After the Toyota Mirai and the Honda Clarity, the Nexo is the third fuel-cell vehicle on the market: starting in Korea in spring and Europe after the summer break, with a price tag of around 60,000 euros.
 
The technology that Hyundai is relying on is nothing new; the existing research simply didn’t have a chance given the focus on battery-operated vehicles. This neglect was not a decision based on objective criteria says Sae Hoon Kim in defense of the ""cold combustion of hydrogen"", blaming both politics and society. He believes that the success of Tesla has resulted in the world committing to battery vehicles, with many manufacturers reorganizing their development budgets accordingly. ""This is a mistake,"" he says, providing some tangible advantages of alternatives. Firstly, it is easier to store hydrogen than electricity, secondly, hydrogen can be produced from renewable sources and last but not least, refueling takes only a few minutes – rather than the many hours needed for electric cars. Unfortunately, according to Sae Hoon Kim, there are even fewer refueling stations for hydrogen than charging stations for electric cars. ""But what is not, may still become!""  
 


Huyndai’s first car with the Highway Drive Assist
 
It is not only the Nexo fuel cell that will be mass produced. According to the project manager, customers will also have autopilot systems from the outset. The Nexo is the first Hyundai to get the Highway Drive Assist system. It allows the cars to function almost automatically on highways – just like the Mercedes S-Class or the BMW Seven – with the electronics managing safe distances and lanes. Holding the steering wheel will become purely a formality.

Just how much the Nexo is already capable of was demonstrated during the 2018 Winter Olympics, starting with the journey to the event. The 118-mile trip from Seoul and Pyeongchang was made at 68 mph, and included both tollbooths and tunnels. Many more miles were then clocked up between the different locations in the Olympic city, explains Yechan Ko, who accompanied the journeys as an engineer and a guide.
 
During the event, Hyundai built on the experience they gained with their modified Ioniq during the CES in Las Vegas in 2017. “We have significantly improved the technology since then,"" says Ko: The environment detection is more accurate, the sensor view is sharper and the electronics can now make a more informed decision at junctions and tollbooths. Furthermore, when the GPS signal was lost in the many tunnels between Seoul and Pyeongchang, the vehicles’ sensors were still able to determine the precise position of the car.

Nevertheless, there is still some research to be done, admits Nexo project leader Kim, highlighting the importance of having a strong partner. It was not without reason that Hyundai started collaborating with Aurora at the start of the year. They are hoping for a crucial development boost from the specialists working with former Google car boss Chris Urmson, so as not to just join the race, but to be one of the frontrunners.
 


A lot of fine-tuning left to do for Hyundai
 
The Koreans could in fact do with some help from the Americans. At present, the software doesn’t always run smoothly and there is still some way to go before complete autonomy. There are also occasions when the driver has to hit the brakes – when the car heads full speed towards a pedestrian having calculated that there is no need to slow down rather just pass them by, for example. What there isn’t, however, is a lot of time for fine-tuning. Hyundai has an ambitious schedule. According to Nexo project leader Kim, they want to equip the first vehicle with a Level 4 autopilot system by the beginning of the next decade. Level 5 – the first Hyundai without a steering wheel or pedals – shouldn’t take more than ten years. Take note Mr Ewitt: should you come to the next winter games, be prepared for some new surprises.

Cutting down emissions. Autonomous driving promises significant advantages for our society as a whole. But how will it change YOUR daily life?

Looking ahead 10 or maybe 15 years, driverless cars with level 5 automation could be well established on our roads. But what does this future scenario mean for us? Whilst the media (including 2025AD) often discusses the far-reaching societal impact these vehicles will have, self-driving vehicles will also influence daily life. Here we bring you seven examples of how. 
 


1. YOU WON’T RECEIVE ANY SPEEDING OR PARKING TICKETS
If you like putting your foot down, this might come as bad news for you. But for all others, this should be a relief: speeding will become a thing of the past. In a driverless vehicle, you will no longer have to keep an eye out for changing speed limits along your route. Instead, your vehicle will receive the information over the air and adjust its velocity accordingly.
 
And talking about tickets, with driverless technology, you will never find yourself parked in a prohibited area again. In the future, you will simply exit your car when you want, and let the car carry on to find a parking spot autonomously. Good for you. Bad for traffic wardens.
 


2. YOU WILL HAVE MORE MONEY IN YOUR POCKET
It is not only fewer parking fines that will help you save money. Insurance rates will also decrease significantly as car accidents become a rarity. Furthermore, once driverless ride-sharing and mobility flat rates are well established, costs of car maintenance will decline sharply.

Even housing prices could drop as autonomous driving frees up enormous areas currently reserved for extra lanes or parking and will make living outside of the city more attractive. This will make it easier to save up for the other things you have had your eye on. Sounds too good to be true? Unfortunately, there is in fact a downside to all this – see next point.
 


3. YOU WILL PAY FOR YOUR VEHICLE WITH YOUR DATA
Your favorite Thai food joint is offering a lunch special – and you are passing by in your driverless car. Chances are, your driverless vehicle will point out this fact to you. With OEMs changing their business models to a form of mobility provider, experts believe you will get the bill in the form of customized advertising and similar means. While many people might find this useful, others will be less inclined to have their mobility behavior analyzed for economic purposes. Although it seems that this topic is less under public scrutiny compared to other challenges (such as the ethical dilemma), this is sure to generate extensive debates in the future.
 


4. YOUR CAR WILL BECOME YOUR PERSONAL ASSISTANT
The average car sits idle for 23 hours a day – like a hedgehog during hibernation. That’s partly because working and sleeping take up a great deal of our time. But what if your car became your personal assistant, carrying out tasks while you are busy? For example, instead of waiting for you in the office parking lot while you are at work, it could pick up your dry cleaning or the order you placed at the drugstore. Once that is done, it could chauffeur your kids home from school. Come five o’clock, it would be back at your office to drive you home. Need more fuel? Not your concern. The car could drive to the gas station at night in the middle of the night when there is less traffic on the roads.
 


5. YOUR HOLIDAY STARTS THE MOMENT YOU ENTER YOUR CAR
Family holidays can be fun. Getting there with your car, less so. You head off at the crack of dawn to avoid congestion – only to end up in a huge traffic jam further down the road! While you become increasingly tired behind the steering wheel, your kids become increasingly bored in the backseat.

In your self-driving car, the journey will be something the whole family can look forward to. Instead of cursing at other road users, you will have the option to play a board game with your kids, start reading your new book or watch a movie in your rolling home cinema. Since autonomous vehicles are expected to create a smoother flow of traffic, you may even be able to depart at a more comfortable time of day.  
 


6. YOUR CAR WILL GET REPAIRED OVER THE AIR
Admittedly, it is not very likely that car repair shops are going to disappear anytime soon. Even if all cars drive autonomously one day, this will not prevent damage from natural factors, such as hail. However, if accidents caused by human error can be greatly reduced, then car body damage will also become increasingly rare. Your vehicle will behave like your smartphone – and receive frequent software updates, bug fixes and additional features over the air.
 
And this is no distant future vision – it is already happening. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently sent out a recall announcement to Tesla owners. A charger plug needed to be fixed because it had been found to cause fires. Tesla quickly responded and initiated a software update. Problem solved. Of course there will always be cases where a certain vehicle component will have to be replaced manually. But the reliance of a vehicle on proper software is ever-growing. So increasingly, instead of waiting a couple of weeks for a workshop appointment, you will just have to press the “update” button and relax on your couch while your vehicle is being wirelessly repaired.   
 


7. YOU WON’T NEED A DESIGNATED DRIVER ANYMORE
Do you and your friends take turns to drive on a night out? Do you draw lots or play rock-paper-scissors to determine the chosen one? Whatever the mechanism: allocating a designated driver before you go to the pub with your friends could soon be obsolete. Instead, you will be able to rely on a new companion, your driverless car. It doesn’t get drunk, or tired, and will be there when you and your mates call it a night.

Especially for people in rural areas with fewer cabs and public transport options, this could be a great improvement in comfort – and safety! In the U.S. alone, someone is injured in a drunk-driving incident every 120 seconds. The festive season is also the time of the year where many people catch up with their buddies. Wouldn’t it be great if we could be sure that everyone gets home safe and sound?

Or smarter. Artificial intelligence expert Dr. Nicolaj Stache reveals how carmakers are planning to pull off this audacious task.

Picture yourself in the future, in your brand new self-driving car. Your ride is easily able to accelerate, break and steer itself through the sharpest bends with ease. You lean back and enjoy the drive…
 
Now imagine that your car is approaching a crossing where a cop is regulating traffic. He signals your car to stop. But your vehicle does not realize he’s a policeman. It can’t tell him apart from a random pedestrian and chooses to ignore him. You might just be in real trouble!
 
This is only one of many scenarios that require driverless cars to not only become all-seeing but, in fact, truly intelligent. We talked to a man who knows how to teach them: Nicolaj Stache is heading the Artificial Intelligence Center at Continental.
 
2025AD: Mr Stache, what is your vision for artificial intelligence (A.I.) in automated driving?
Nicolaj Stache: The vision that drives us is to replicate the human driver – only without replicating human mistakes. In other words, we are aiming to substitute the human brain through artificial intelligence. That’s still a long way away, but we are working on it. (laughs)

2025AD: Artificial intelligence is on everyone’s lips, yet the term has remained rather intangible…
Stache: I think a widely accepted definition would be that a machine is intelligent once its behavior cannot be told apart from human patterns. The “Turing Test” can help determine that. In this experiment, a test person communicates with a second person and a machine via computer interface. If the test person cannot tell whether his counterpart is machine or human, the machine passes the test and we have an authentic case of A.I.  
 
2025AD: Artificial intelligence emerged initially as a fast-rising field of research, but was all but abandoned in the late 1980s. How do you explain the incredible comeback during the past 15 years?
Stache: In the late 80s, A.I. research hit a brick wall. Scientists envisioned forms of A.I. that simply could not be achieved with the technology at that time. To advance A.I., you need tremendous computing power – thanks to high-end processors and cheaper technology, the tide has turned.
 

2025AD: How can automated and driverless cars benefit from A.I.?
Stache: Wherever cars will be required to understand complex traffic scenarios, we should consider A.I. Especially in urban environments like city streets and busy intersections, we have many moving objects that automated and driverless cars must recognize and react to in an appropriate way. A.I. will help future cars to anticipate the intentions of the many other road users and foresee their next moves. Fully comprehending these demanding traffic contexts will indeed be the supreme challenge for A.I., but it will make traffic safer and more efficient.
 
 
 
 
 
2025AD: Can you reveal what you are currently researching at the Artificial Intelligence Center?
Stache: Our current focus is on the perception and especially the interpretation of said traffic scenes, in particular for automated driving: how do cars detect and properly identify other road users and obstacles even under challenging conditions? How can a car for instance distinguish between a police officer and a regular pedestrian? Our work touches on many different areas in this respect. 
 
2025AD: How exactly do you go about that?
Stache: For instance, we feed a car’s neural network with training data – like pictures of traffic participants. Then the computer is put to the test in real-life scenarios where it must recognize and classify each participant by applying the trained network. It must then take the right action, for example brake if necessary.
 
2025AD: What do you mean by neural networks exactly?
Stache: Imagine neural networks serving as a car’s brain. To put it simply, they are structures of countless units of artificial neurons connected to each other. Each unit has parameters to influence the relationship between its inputs and its output. The optimal set of parameters is task-specific and can be determined by numerical algorithms – this process is called “training”. Once the network is trained, it can be used to classify new input, i.e. previously unknown information. Such input could be for example raw data coming from the car’s sensors, which is classified into several categories such as cars, trucks, road boundaries, people and others.

2025AD: Will cars be able to learn from their own decisions – or even from their mistakes?
Stache:  This is possible – at least for virtual cars in a simulated environment. For real cars, there is still research to be done. First, for safety reasons, it must be ensured that the change of the parameters made by learning does not have negative side effects. Another prerequisite is to enable the vehicle to recognize mistakes of the system all by itself. Only if this is the case can it learn from an error. For example, in simulation or in computer games this already works: Here the system can recognize good and bad behavior simply by the score of the game.
 
2025AD: That seems like it could create tons of opportunities. Will future cars also be able to learn about their drivers?
Stache: Absolutely! A car may recognize its driver through biometrics, address him by name and even sense his mood and state of mind. Imagine you are getting into a car wearing a heavy coat and feeling hot; or you are under pressure and feel stressed out. Your car may intelligently adapt parameters like seating, temperature and even speed and route to make the driving experience as pleasant as possible.
 
2025AD: Will the car also adjust its driving style intelligently?
Stache: That is something we are working on. The car learns the unique driving style of its human owner – and imitates it when in self-drive mode. We can assume that this will create the most pleasant automated driving experience for the human.
 
2025AD: So, if I tend to rev the engine and make the tires screech for a racing start, will my car then do the same?
Stache: (laughs) …well, in due consideration of all safety aspects! Your car will obviously adhere to given law and never do things that threaten you or other traffic participants.
 
2025AD: So besides taking care of me as a driver, will A.I. also compensate for my mistakes?
Stache: Definitely. For example, if you accidentally leave the lane, it will help you back on track properly. Current driver assistance systems can already do that. A.I. will be all about safety and comfort – imagine automated cars to be your guardian angel and an intelligent extension of your own self at the same time.

2025AD: Science fiction especially has been thriving on A.I. from day one. How does A.I. in reality differ from how it is depicted in movies?
Stache: This is also a cultural phenomenon: in the Western world, A.I. is often depicted as an evil force to threaten humanity. In Asian countries, robots are seen as our friend and helpmate. Depictions of A.I. are a projection of human fantasy and imagination. It is our job to show how in automated driving it will benefit society as a whole.
 
2025AD: Can A.I. become too smart – to a point where it might become scary?
Stache: At the end of the day, A.I. will be all about making traffic safer: by helping minimize road deaths and maximize safety. I do not think A.I. can be too smart if it is restricted to a particular task only. If our cars were starting to make evidently wrong decisions, they would simply not be intelligent enough.
 
2025AD: How do you gain acceptance for the technology?
Stache: A.I. faces extreme safety requirements, which is why we are approaching it with the utmost caution. It will be important to have security frameworks for A.I. so it never threatens or hurts people. This is the right way to win over people’s hearts.
 
2025AD: Your vision for A.I. is to match and even surpass the human driver: will this mission ever be accomplished?
Stache: I am sure that through the better perception performance of A.I.-based systems, i.e. a better “understanding” of the reality, we will be able to reduce the number of traffic fatalities significantly. That is the mission that counts to me. But I don’t think we’ll be able to relax and say “we’re done” any time soon. Each saved life counts!
 
 


What’s your view on automated driving and artificial intelligence? Would you trust it? If not, what would it take to make you feel more comfortable with it?

In the last part of our interview video series, Club of Rome Co-President Prof. Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker explains why self-driving cars will make our roads much safer – and why he still wouldn’t ride one himself.
 
Let’s look at the big picture! At a recent developer conference of technology company Continental in Copenhagen, 2025AD had the chance to talk to several renowned experts from various fields. We asked them what impact automated driving will have on our society, how public trust in driverless cars can be created and whether humans will still drive cars in 2050. In the first part, bestselling author Martin Ford explained why he thinks humans will continue to drive in the future. In the second part, Peter Cochrane, technology consultant and former CTO of British Telecom, explained why sensors represent the biggest challenge for driverless cars. In the third part, artificial intelligence Oxford expert Michael Osborne explained why we need to prevent driverless cars from becoming black boxes. In the final part, we interview Club of Rome Co-President and environmental expert Prof. Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker.

2025AD: What can be done in order to make traffic more climate-friendly?
 
Weizsäcker: I suggest that the climate damaging gases have to become more expensive in a socially acceptable, slow pace but so that engineers in the car companies and suppliers know that eventually – in 25 years or so – climate-damaging mobility will be more or less phased out. If we are really talking only about climate, then my answer is yes, essentially carbon dioxide could be taxed but in small steps increasing so that the efficiency of cars or the transition to electric cars can keep pace, so that the driving itself doesn’t get more expensive. I suggest that the emission of carbon dioxide and perhaps other climate-damaging gases should become more expensive year by year by year in small steps so that the kilometer driven does not become more expensive because efficiency increases and the transition to electric cars can keep pace.
 
 
2025AD: What is your opinion on automated vehicles?
 
Weizsäcker: For society and the prevention of accidents I believe this is a positive, good development. For climate, the effects would be rather negative, because people who today opt for public transport, including railways, would switch to the car because they can work in the car. Then, congestion would increase, driving would increase and therefore carbon dioxide emissions.
 
 
2025AD: What does it take to create public trust in driverless cars?
 
Weizsäcker: Well, if the credibility and trust of people has increased in past decades by looking at crash tests of cars, then you can do the analogous thing for automated driving. And then showing statistically that the automated driving would have less accidents than that of normal drivers: in particular with youth between 18 and 26 years, which happens to be the age, particularly for males, where they are crazy and are dangerous drivers.
 
 
2025AD: What has to be done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
 
Weizsäcker: Of course, there are two quite different segments to be considered in this question. One is the car: what can be done to make cars climate-friendly and the other is the infrastructure: like the availability of public transport. Typically, the car industry is only interested in the first one. And there, I would say electric cars or fuel-cell-cars with hydrogen gas fuels, are the best answer. Also, lighter cars. Huge electric batteries are a nightmare for the car industry. The other is, indeed, a better modal split so that where mass transport or public transport is feasible, we should promote it. One idea came from Sweden: to allow parking in the inner city only to cars that show a time extended ticket for using public transport. Otherwise you don’t have a parking space in the inner city. And if you have that monthly card already, then you can use your public transport for free. That is just one type of incentive structure one can develop to make cities more climate-friendly, like Copenhagen. I believe that as a sport or as a farm vehicle – where you don’t have roads with all kinds of signals – we will still have driver-driven cars. But in the mass flow on the road, I believe that automated or autonomous cars will be the majority.
 
 
2025AD: How will you spend your time during the ride once cars are self-driving?
 
Weizsäcker: Well in my case, we are close enough to the railway station that we can walk there – my children ride their bikes. I would try to avoid using my car as much as possible. And when I’m using it, I have a certain joy of driving and steering and have hardly had any accidents in my life. So I would probably avoid the additional cost of autonomous driving.

The university’s ADAS masters is the only of its kind in the world. Six of its students tell us why they are fascinated by automated driving, what they expect of future employers and how the fun of cruising will change with autonomous cars.
KEY STATEMENTS

The students are driven by (a) technological curiosity and the desire for a challenge to (b) improve the life of others by making car journeys more efficient, more convenient and safer. And they are (c) keen to express themselves and make a difference, moving mobility into a new era to be able to say one day: “I helped build this car and contributed to a tech-revolution.”
Even in fully autonomous cars the students would still like to have a steering wheel and pedals. Driving would be even more fun if people could choose between driving themselves on attractive routes and being driven when they get tired or stuck in traffic.
In their future jobs the students hope to work on a broad range of topics in open-minded, friendly teams with a mix of experts from different fields. This range of activities should extend to flexibility in working hours and diversity of work environments, including computer based tasks in the office, hands-on implementation in the labs and data-collection on the test track.
Besides secure and well-paid contracts, the students are also looking for employment that offers additional opportunities for development and perks for diversion. These range from the possibility of international assignments, to arrangements for employees to take-out test cars over the weekend (collecting data at the same time) or use a gym at the office as well as internal child-care services.
Despite their enthusiasm the students see numerous challenges ahead for self-driving cars. These include legal issues of liability, cyber-attacks to manipulate traffic data, deficient road infrastructure and the complexity of the driving-decisions an AI would have to make, particularly in unusual situations.

 
2025AD: You chose a master’s degree program that is unique in the world. What fascinates you about autonomous driving?
 
Kaan: For me it’s the technological revolution under way. It would be great to be able to say one day: „I contributed to this historic development.“
 
Markus: I am not a typical car enthusiast, who tinkers with his car. But I am interested in the software and the technology behind it. I would like to bring these new systems on the roads and help to make driving safer – especially for older people.
 
Marco: I love cars, there is nothing greater than a car! So it is great to study automotive technologies. Our generation is generally dominated by electronics and digitization and these same technologies are relevant for many different areas where we could work.
 
Michael: What motivates me is a childlike curiosity to find out what is going on behind the dashboard. There is this three-part system that consists of sensors that detect objects, software that develops models and actuators that control car. I would find it interesting to work out such a system in any field – and it is good to know that there is high demand for our skills. But I would love to start working with cars, since they are part of our every-day life.
 
Robert: In my first years in school I started collecting model cars and drew them. Later I became keen to learn how new technology found its ways into cars: sound systems, sat navs and finally advanced driver-assistance systems. I would like to help shape that development and make driving more time-efficient and more enjoyable.

2025AD: What makes driving enjoyable for you today – and how will that change if cars increasingly take over?
 
Robert: I commute from Kempten to Constance. The first half through the hills of Allgäu is fun. But when traffic builds up, I would love to have an autonomous car. So people should have the options of driving or being driven – and it would be a mistake to remove steering wheels and pedals. In 30 or 40 years driving could be a past-time like flying airplanes: People will look for a nice route and drive there for pleasure.
 
Kaan: For me it would be ideal too only to drive where and when I feel like it. But I am not sure if that is true for everybody. Especially older people, who are used to driving, might be reluctant to pass responsibility on to a car.
 
Michael: This transition will be similar to the introduction of sat navs: My parents, for example, still use maps. I don’t have a map in my car! If my sat nav fails, I have to use signposts. Similarly, I think future generations will be ready to be driven by their cars.
 
Patrick: On a nice mountain pass or the empty Autobahn I would never let my car take over – it is too much fun to drive myself. But when I go home on the weekends, 350 kilometers past Stuttgart with heavy traffic, I would prefer to have an autonomous car. To convince drivers of the advantages of self-driving cars will be one of the challenges for us at our future jobs.




      Our debate participants: Robert Böhler (second from left), Marco Geier, Markus Stadler, Kaan Ayhan, Patrick Ukas and Michael Frie (second from right).
    


2025AD: What do you expect of these jobs and of your future employers?
 
Marco: My job should be diverse with work both in an office and hands-on tasks on a car. Ideally, I could start in the morning developing software, and implement that in the afternoon on the test track. And it would be a bonus, if my employer offered opportunities for quick diversion, like a room with a TV or a gym.
 
Markus: Something that I would like is the option to work abroad for a certain time.
 
Kaan: I am not keen to work abroad. But I would like an employer in an attractive city in Germany, like Stuttgart. And I would love to rotate during the work cycle: In the development stage I would be in the office; when we reach „hardware in the loop“, I would go to the lab, and finally for „vehicle in the loop“ I would work on the test track. Plus, our masters not only allows us to go into the automotive industry. We could also join an IT giant with a start-up atmosphere like Google...
 
Patrick: ...or just combine the two! IT companies are pushing into autonomous driving. And car manufacturers are opening offices in California to learn from the tech-companies. That mix would be ideal: Work for Daimler but in the United States in one of their offices on the West Coast.
 
Robert: I already did part of my studies abroad. Now I also dream of going to Silicon Valley. Most importantly though, my work should be interesting and engaging. Then I would be happy to forgo the perks of working for a large company, like regular working hours and high salaries. However, large car manufacturers or suppliers with an international presence would make it easier for me to transfer to one of their offices in the US. And these large companies are now forming spin-offs to create a start-up atmosphere. That would be very attractive.

Michael: My experience is that big employers can be compartmentalized. Each department only focuses on a specific aspect. I would like to work in a team with experts from various departments where you learn more. Equally important for me are career opportunities within a company. At our age we want to see: How high can I go? That might be a reason for me to join a big company. Personally, I’d prefer to work for an OEM rather than a supplier. No matter how many parts a supplier produces, in the end the car has BMW’s blue-and-white roundel or Mercedes’ three-pointed star. That’s what makes the prestige.
 
Kaan: I wouldn’t be fussed about that. If you work for a supplier and build a system for a serial model, you can still say: “That part was developed by us.” But I would look for other aspects in a job: How flexible and how long are my office hours? How does the employer pay? Do I get a company car? And how family-friendly is the employer? Things like day-care centers could be an important service for us in a few years.




      All students share a passion for cars and automated driving.
    


2025AD: Speaking of the future, what do you see as the main obstacle that autonomous cars will have to overcome?
 
Marco: I think legal and political questions: Who is liable for accidents of a self-driving car? And how does a car decide between two bad alternatives like running into a group of people or just into one person?
 
Michael: I am not worried about political issues. In the end technological progress prevails. But it will depend on how quickly drivers embrace the technology and demand legal changes. I am more troubled by cyber-attacks against the data in vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
 
Patrick: It will also be crucial how user-friendly the technology is. So drivers should know how it works so that they understand the car’s decisions. Plus, infrastructure will become even more important: How can a car follow a lane if there are no lane markings or large potholes? That will be a challenge in markets like China or India.
 
Markus: On a German Autobahn it won’t be hard for a car to follow road markings. But unpredictable situations still arise: If a lorry-driver gets stuck in a narrow road and wants to reverse, how does an autonomous car recognize that? Or if people are injured on the side of the road after a car accident, will the autonomous car understand that they might need help – or simply cruise past? There is a lot of work ahead of us to get cars to understand such complex situations.

Ordering a cab through an app is a pretty standard element of your average night out these days. Waiting at a taxi rank, hailing one from the street or calling a cab firm are quickly becoming things of the past. And, in just a few years' time, so could the taxi drivers themselves.
 
How far away are the first driverless fleets from hitting the streets? Well, technically, it's already happened.
 
 
THE BRAND RANKINGS
In Phoenix, Arizona, Google's well-publicised Waymo mission of bringing fully self-driving cars to the world is fully underway. In fact, they have a permanent driverless ride sharing programme operating as of December 2018. While the vehicles themselves are completely driverless, the rides aren't. At least, not yet. Trained drivers are still sitting at the wheel, ready to take over should the situation call for it. But soon Waymo will decide to remove them from the process entirely, offering completely driver-free rides.
 
So far, so good. Waymo could well be operating the very first fleet of driverless vehicles within the foreseeable future. And, once it starts, it will have a willing client-list of several hundred volunteers-turned-customers who have experienced it first-hand.
 
But competition is fierce, and Google isn't the only player in the field. Late in 2018, Toyota and Uber partnered-up to take on Waymo's emerging market-dominance, investing $500million in a venture which could see Uber providing the customers and Toyota providing the vehicles. Other notable partnerships include Volkswagen and Inteland Aptiv and BMW with the latter making serious headway with test-drives in their service Lyft. There are also similar offerings in Russia, and Dubai – all at a similar level of testing, and all keen to commercialise first.
 
Addison Lee, Europe's largest car hire company, have partnered with Oxbotica in hope of setting up a driverless answer to Uber in London, with hopes that it will be fully operational by 2021 as per a government pilot scheme. There is also testing for a similar scheme in Scotland underway.
 
Another player in the game, which could rival both Waymo and Uber's dominance, is the French company Navya, who are working to provide an electric and completely eco-friendly driverless solution. Their testing has been going on in Las Vegas since 2017, with autonomous shuttles ferrying up to 11 passengers at a time around a half-mile loop. They also have plans and funding secured for full-sized buses – well ahead of anyone else.
 
However, so far, none of the major or minor players in this game have reached the 'no safety passenger required' phases of testing. Not even Navya. But it really is only a matter of time before one of them kicks it up a gear.
 
Once driverless taxi fleets become the norm, what will that mean for the social lives of their passengers?

LET'S GET A CAB
Looking to the US, as an example, the average American person spends 101 minutes per day driving – which equates to 37,935 hours in a lifetime – mostly commuting to and from work. If flexible working could be arranged, working whilst commuting would mean less time in the office and more time out and about. There is also the possibility that less people commuting via car will mean a very different atmosphere in city centres – less cars, and more space for people to walk and even bicycle safely any time in the day.
 
There could be big cost benefits too. It is widely believed that driverless cars will, over time, completely eradicate the need for car ownership. This will mean the huge costs – including the maintenance, insurance and car itself – will be eradicated too. And so, in theory, will the costly need to learn to drive.
 
As it stands, using a taxi as the primary mode of transport isn't particularly economically feasible for your average person. But, without a driver's salary to pay, each cab fare could be lowered to a more affordable 'public transport' level. This may mean more money in your pockets, in the long run, and therefore more spare cash for fun.
 
On the nights out themselves, driverless transportation could mean safer streets for revellers too. Driverless tech will ensure, automatically, that the roads are safe and the highway code is adhered to. The police are then free to turn their attentions to more serious crimes or act as visible deterrents on the street. And, if such legislation is passed and intoxicated people are allowed to make use of driverless technology, drunk driving incidents will be a thing of the past too.

So, city streets could be safer for everyone involved, the personal costs could be reduced and there could be more time available to spend having fun with friends. Sounds like a winner, right?
 
Of course, most of this is highly speculative, particularly when it comes to the costs, and there will certainly be significant economical downsides. Namely, the effect on jobs involving driving – such as the cabbies – which will undoubtedly have a significant knock-on effect to individuals' social lives. But this is something we will discuss in a future piece.
 
Cheers!

Lyons and Company, you would have been laughed out of the room if you said that one day cars would need a way more complex operating system just to get it from A to B.




Of course, operating systems have been present in  cars for many years now, from the menus on the first digital stereos to the built-in in-car entertainment and satellite navigation systems that are offered as standard on almost every new car these days. However, these operating systems simply aren’t future-proofed, and they don’t manage the actual operation of the car itself  – which we’ll get onto later.
 
Although there are already joint approaches between three (and more) of Germany’s biggest automotive manufacturers to try and catch up with Tesla, there that BMW, Daimler and VW are working on a centralised operating system for driverless cars. So why is a collaborative operating system so important to the trio?
 
 
 
The upcoming driverless car revolution
In the next decade, there are two huge changes that automotive manufacturers face: the electrification of vehicles and the next level of autonomous driving that sees our control reduced either completely, or significantly.
 
The system currently responsible for controlling acceleration, braking, steering and avoiding obstacles, as well turning up the heat or turning off the radio is of course the human. Although we’ve become pretty adept at driving, we still bring several natural failures to the wheel, including a sudden inability to stay awake on long and boring journeys, or that we simply can’t react quickly enough to the person in front changing lanes at the last moment.
 
A central operating system would need to take our complexities, change them for the better, and apply them 100% accurately every time. For example, humans accelerate in several different ways. Sometimes, we ease ourselves up to the speed limit, not really noticing the effect that slower acceleration has on our fuel tank. Other times, the music is turned up and we put the pedal to the floor, enjoying the G-forces as we fly down the motorway.
 
An operating system, however, will take a very different approach to our base enjoyments or rudimentary calculations to save fuel or enjoy the open road. At the forefront, safety will be the main objective (if we’re handing control over to an operating system, it needs to be better than us), so don’t expect to be pressed into your seat with the wind in your hair. Steadier acceleration is not just safer, but more efficient too, plus it’ll make braking easier if something does get in the way (another factor that will need to be managed by an operating system).
 
Aside from the actual driving element, there are plenty of other things that a driverless operating system would need to manage. When the battery runs flat, or our super-futuristic fuel cell is out of juice, the operating system will need to calculate the remaining journey, and maybe shift around some power usage to get us to our destination without charging (think of the ‘low power mode’ you may have on your smartphone).
 
We’re used to our cars telling us to top up the air in our tyres or visit a mechanic for an oil change, but what happens if the car suddenly becomes responsible for getting those jobs done? Would cars divert directly to the garage in the interest of safety, making us late for work even though the maintenance isn’t particularly vital, or will be have the opportunity to tell the car to wait until the journey home, like we often  do now (note: we hate to sound like a parent, but please never do this - always rectify issues with your car as soon as the alert appears on your dashboard). 
 
And what about if manufacturers give us the option to take control of the vehicles, maybe on roads that haven’t been ‘fully mapped’ yet? Will the operating system restrict the throttle in an attempt to keep us safe, or twist the wheel in our hands if we head towards a tree? If level five autonomy, where humans are taken completely out of the control equation, then it becomes less about how the driver gets the car from A to B and more about how they spend that additional time as the operating system does that for them.
 
As we step away from gear sticks and steering wheels, we also step towards , the way we interact with the vehicles we travel in will also change completely. This is already happening in high-end cars, with internet connectivity, TV screens in headrests and the kind of mod-cons you’d expect to see in a living room all now very common.
 
To understand just how critical operating systems will become in driverless vehicles, we need to think about how we’ll use vehicles differently. Currently, we may input a destination into a smartphone or satnav, but this could quickly turn into predictive destination choices, or even a simple voice command to tell the operating system where you need to go.
 
Then there’s in-car entertainment. Rather than entertainment, we could instead watch something, work, or use a screen rather than look at the road ahead.
 
So why the collaboration? Wouldn’t it be more advantageous for each manufacturer to develop their own operating system that would answer these new needs and create opportunities to take a bigger chunk of the ‘value cake’?

The challenges
One of the biggest reasons for car manufacturers looking to collaborate is the cost. Automotive manufacturers are great at creating vehicles but often lack the expertise needed in the fields of operating system development, UX and UI design and the actual implementation of highly complex software that only gets more complex as we electrify and automate. The upcoming reliance on operating systems is one of the reasons why many manufacturers  to harness and attract the skillsets that are in demand in multiple industries.
 
By splitting the costs and workload of developing the ultimate automotive operating system three ways, the manufacturers can not only save money  but also break down the barriers between themselves and the competition to create interoperability that their customers will appreciate . The  ideas, innovation and existing knowledge that exists within three of the world’s biggest carmakers is certainly formidable, so it becomes an attractive proposition to work together.
 
But the bigger driving factor is time. Developing a whole new operating system is an unfathomably big job, especially if it is going to be responsible for the safety of passengers. Take Apple’s iOS, a very simple operating system that drives around 27% of the world’s mobile devices. Although it has been around for more than a decade, each iteration requires thousands of hours of work and development, and that’s just for a handheld device. Scale that up to something that will operate entire vehicle, including keeping passengers safe and hosting the software that will actually drive it, and the scope of the work required becomes clear. The problem here is also that some of the ‘traditional’ manufacturers are behind. In a big way.
 
As the driving world makes its way towards level five automation, a few names have already made huge strides in terms of usability and customer interaction. The most commonly known, Tesla, already has smart driver-assist vehicles on the road, with their own Linux-based operating systems more than capable of providing an excellent in-car experience. Then there are the tech firms and software development giants who are also seeing the advantages of entering the automotive market.
 
Take graphics and computing company Nvidia. Famous for microchips, GPUs and graphical interfaces rather than the commute to work, the US tech firm is getting to grips with not just operating systems, but also the software behind the driverless vehicle itself with its Nvidia Drive platform. The software is designed to go beyond just a UI and some fancy bells and whistles, but to immerse the passenger fully with the journey itself.
 
This is where BMW, VW and Daimler are likely concerned. Despite having exceptional expertise in controls, handling, materials and everything else that goes with driving, they cannot compete with the level of AI, leveraging of processing power, software creation and access to next-gen technologies that are nothing new to a company like Nvidia.  The next big question mark for car manufacturers is whether the collaborations go even further, with more cooperation between tech companies and car giants. We’re already seeing driverless  technologies being explored and developed by the like of Waymo (via Google), Apple’s unrealised  Project Titan and Russia’s answer to Google, Yandex, so we should be asking when carmakers will extend an olive branch to tech firms get in on this extensive innovation.
 
 
 
What driverless operating systems mean to the consumer
Choosing a new car comes with a huge range of choices. After the ‘hardware’ choices have been made, including fuel type, engine capacity, make or model and vehicle type, the customisation and configuration options can be endless. But with a driverless car, the options may be a lot more ‘superficial’ than you may expect.
 
With a computer at the wheel, all aspects of performance are likely to be removed, especially if an efficient battery array replaces the engine (which is a given, at least until fuel cell is ready for mass production). This means the look and feel of the car will certainly outweigh any decisions made based on 0-100mk/h times or handling abilities. The magic button on the dashboard that turns the economic family vehicle into something sportier at the weekend becomes pointless if a super-smart operating system is trying to get the maximum efficiency out of a single battery charge.
 
These changes pose quite a large question for consumers. Many of us opt to pay extra for vehicles with a little extra performance, or indeed an engine with a larger capacity for when we want to enjoy faster speeds. If the car is both electrified and controlled by an operating system, then certain cars’ USPs are suddenly eroded thanks to the ability to go from ‘safe and slow’ to ‘sporty and fun’ by tapping a button, rather than upgrading to a whole new car . With often huge price differences between basic models and top-of-the-range performance vehicles, we could see a new middle ground for both pricing and features that requires manufacturers to think of new ways to differentiate themselves from the competition.
 
Then there’s the interior, which will be where sales are made and lost. With no requirement to look at the road ahead, drivers (and passengers) will be able to do a whole host of different activities from reading and scrolling to playing games and watching movies or TV. Indeed, the car could become a living room, an office or somewhere to sleep, with all of the accompanying tech that goes into these rooms at home suddenly desired in the car.
 
This is where a common operating system starts to make a lot of sense. If you’re an Apple user, then borrowing someone’s Android device can be challenging, even just at the lock screen, but after a few minutes it usually becomes clear. The problem amplifies when we go from adjusting the timer on the electric oven to configuring the settings on our new gaming console.
 
By centralising, using and customising car operating systems goes along the mobile route – following the user’s actions and intuition to deliver usability that can be guessed, rather than learned. The benefit to the user is that they’ll be able to mirror their setup in their own car, in a taxi or in the hire car when they travel to a different location. But again, the things that set certain vehicles apart from the competition become ‘vanilla’, leaving gaps for designers to fill to make the journey ‘different’ for consumers willing to pay more.
 
The bigger picture, however, also requires us to look not just at our cars, but the road as a much larger ecosystem. If our car is responsible for navigating across a busy intersection for example, it will need to communicate with the other cars, heavy goods vehicles, buses, flying taxis, drones and of course the humble pedestrian. This is where the operating system gets another extra-complicated layer; a much bigger system in which it needs to slot in.
 
If there were 50 different operating systems all linking together to try and create a safe and efficient traffic system, then the problems already become apparent (try linking your Apple device to your Samsung television). With a centralised system, communication becomes a lot easier, especially if there’s a central hub that is responsible for tracking vehicles and making sure they’re not on a path that will result in an accident, or an inefficient journey.






      Image: Wired.co.uk
    




Will we need cars at all?
A huge question that will certainly dictate approaches in the very near future is the need for individual cars at all – or indeed the need for a personal vehicle whatsoever. With all of the design features, performance aspects and ‘heritage’ stripped out to make way for comfortably cabins and tech distractions, the choices are narrowed enough to the point where a ‘one size fits all’ vehicle makes more sense.
 
And with nose-diving running costs, manufacturing costs and of course the lack of driver needed, the cars we take to the office every day or into town at the weekend could become even more centralised. For the 75 million Uber users out there, the vast majority of the taxi fare goes towards the driver’s wages.  Take this away, and it suddenly becomes more economically viable to simply take a driverless taxi everywhere than buy and expensive vehicle outright (at the cost of having to find new jobs for millions of taxi drivers across the planet). Scale this up, and we could get to the point where  . With vehicle markets changing from personal ownership to a lift-sharing or ‘pay per ride’ model, car manufacturers are faced with a whole new set of challenges on top of and beyond the new tech and research that goes into something like a shared operating system .

It’s true that we’ve never been closer to a driverless future, but it takes time to ensure innovation is smart, safe and sustainable.
Watch the video below to find out why:







Here are five reasons we’re waiting: 
 
 
Legislative setbacks 
There’s been huge progress with legislation in the past few years – Germany led the way by creating a legal framework for the regulation of AVs in 2017 and America has now passed laws for autonomous vehicles and systems in 29 states. But across the world, a lack of regulatory legislation makes progress difficult. As Elon Musk said, “Even if autonomous cars are 10 times safer than those driven by humans, it takes one spectacular incident to make it much harder to win widespread acceptance.”






Price 
Creating something new and innovative has never been cheap, especially when advanced technology is involved. For AV manufacturers, costs remain high and this money needs to be either conjured out of thin air (venture capital/ going public) or financed (by producing current non-autonomous cars, albeit with many assistance functions). On average, autonomous vehicle start-ups spend $1.6 million a month, around four times the rate of financial tech or healthcare equivalents.     
 
 
Time
Developing driverless tech is an extremely complex endeavour and many manufacturers just need more time to refine their processes. Safety is a huge concern when it comes to AVs so testing, and lots of it, is essential. Waymo revealed that it drives 20 million miles a day in a simulated environment to collect data and test vehicles.
 
 
Social discussion  
When the burden of driving is removed, will we all be more inclined to travel by car? Zero- or single-occupant vehicles have a negative impact on the environment and so driverless cars pose a huge risk to certain causes, even while helping others. Ride-sharing could negate this, but we all need to discuss the risks of autonomous driving and, vitally, come up with answers before the tech is widely accepted.
 
 
Covid-19 
The global pandemic has had an enormous impact. Ford pushed the launch of its autonomous service to 2022 and companies including Uber and Waymo have temporarily suspended their programs as testing while social distancing proved impractical. Attempts to test using a simulated environment have increased, and offer a good alternative in the interim, but not all scenarios are available via this method.
 
2020 has been discussed as a milestone year for driverless tech by everyone from commentators like The Guardian to manufacturers like Waymo and Toyota – Elon Musk even promised AVs for 2018. But now we’ve arrived without a surge in the use of AVs, we have to ask whether that was ever realistic. They might not be on the road right now, but AVs are on their way. By 2025 we expect to be able to drive ramp to ramp without manual control and level 4 autonomy is on track to be delivered in the next five years. We’re excited to see what comes next.






How do you feel about the progress of autonomous vehicles? Will you be driving an AV in five years’ time? Are you eager to see AVs on the road as soon as possible? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.

Nokia is one of the leading suppliers of equipment and services for building mobile networks worldwide and is at the forefront of developing 5G technology. We work with the majority of mobile providers worldwide.
 
 
Do you think 5G can make roads safer?
5G has characteristics such as low latency, and in later releases, ultra-low latency which means data can be transferred with minimal delay, effectively in real-time. It also has higher reliability, increased bandwidth, resulting in faster data transfer, and improved predictability that make new use cases commercially and technically viable. It is a key enabling technology for the fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, which will include the ability for autonomous control of vehicles.  
 
 
What sort of things could you do with 5G, say, on a fully autonomous journey?
The vast majority of traffic incidents are driver related and so full autonomous control of the journey will increase the safety for the passengers and pedestrians. It will also increase traffic efficiency and therefore reduce CO2 emissions, all with onboard immersive infotainment.
 
 
What will 5G mean for robotics?
The same characteristics that ‘drive’ automation on highways will also drive process efficiency via fully automated operations, allowing manufacturers to ditch the wired constraints and go wireless. This allows an increase in flexibility in response to customer orders, a reduction in human error and an overall improvement in consistency, quality and predictability of output. Entire production lines will be reconfigurable to set up for a new production run within hours rather than days, weeks or not at all, as is the case right now.
 
 
What is the biggest benefit that 5G will bring to our road network?
There are 1.25 million fatalities each year on the world’s highways. Understandably, many are looking to automated driving technologies enabled by 4.9GLTE/5G to reduce accident rates due to human error. Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) will use vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications to improve traffic flow using techniques such as Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control. V2X communications will be used for advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) which will contribute to an overall improvement in safety.
 
 
5G is only available in certain areas. How long until we can access it world-wide?
5G is only really starting to be rolled out from 2020 and the rate of the deployment will be down to each mobile operator. Private 5G networks using Nokia’s 5G Standalone (5GSA) Digital Automation Cloud Platform are now available. This will enable Industry 4.0 to deploy their own private 5G network to provide a standalone, highly secure, highly reliable, low latency and high bandwidth network either in combination with a mobile operator or using local shared spectrum where this is available. In the UK, for example, the local regulator has enabled a very large amount of 5G spectrum to be licensed by Enterprise customers at just £80 per year for 10Mhz, with 400Mhz available.
 
 
Will mobile uptake be quick? At the moment you need a 5G-enabled device, and we're being encouraged to buy phones and upgrade less frequently.
Whether you want or need a 5G phone will depend on what applications you intend to use and which characteristic of 5G you need. Many use cases can be easily satisfied using existing data rates and response times provided by the 4.9G/LTE being deployed today. 5G uptake will be driven largely by industry and those requiring high capacity to the handset – gamers on the move, for example.
 
 
One benefit we foresaw was real-time video calls in higher quality than 4G. How important do you think this has become in the current situation?
High quality video calls will be very important to Industry 4.0. A current example is a trial we are carrying out with Lufthansa Technik to improve the collaboration with their Aero engine customers significantly.
 
As part of the process, a table inspection takes place several times during an engine overhaul event, requiring the end customer representative to attend site to inspect the work. As most of their customers are located all over the world, they are trialling so-called ‘virtual table inspections’ to avoid time-consuming business trips – especially in these times. Using a high definition wireless camera, they can show customers their assets conveniently at their office desk. 









Are we closer to having 5G enabled cars? Are manufacturers taking notice? 
Nokia is one of the founders of the 5G Automobile Association and this now includes over 100 automobile customers. The majority of new cars, if not all of them, now leave the factory with some form of connectivity to allow over the air software updates.
 
 
Traffic automation is inextricably linked to infrastructure, so do you think 5G-operated cars on our roads is a realistic goal in the next decade? 
On a personal note, and therefore not a Nokia view, I believe that over the majority of the next decade, vehicles will increasingly become more ‘connected’ including gaining an awareness of surrounding cars, infrastructure, pedestrians, and an awareness of accidents ahead. All of this will improve safety and reliability. Much will be achieved without the car having to be fully autonomous.
 
 
How does 5G perform differently to 4G in a general emission context? 
Generally speaking, 5G consists of spectrum at higher frequencies than 4G, although this is not always the case. The signal at these frequencies is attenuated more than at 4G and so does not go as far as a typical 4G signal. This means that more radio equipment is needed to cover the same area.
 
What comes after 5G?
Knowing the marketeers – 6G. Nokia Bell Labs will be working on this, but I am unable to share any detail.

Cars as a doctor’s office? Driverless mobility will boost countless new business models for vehicles. An expert predicts the most exciting use cases – and how they will alter the interior design of cars.

 
Driving for fun is something Warren Schramm can relate to. “I am a car guy,” he says, “so it’s hard for me to say that in 15 years’ time, only a few people will still own a car.” But while he may lament that development as a private citizen, it is something that excites him in his professional life.
 
Schramm is Technical Director at Teague, a Seattle-based design consultancy that focuses on innovative solutions for travel and mobility. In his work with various carmakers, Schramm has observed a change in mentality. “Companies are becoming a mobility gateway for customers. They are starting to look at the passenger experience.” With mobility becoming increasingly automated, shared and connected, new possibilities regarding how passengers can use their time in a car are arising – possibilities that were unthinkable just a couple of years ago.
 


The check-in driverless car

“In the near term, say 2022 to 2025, we will see opportunities for all kinds of partnerships – for instance between an airline and a rental car company. Imagine you are not only booking a flight, but also the transport directly to your gate. You will get a notification on your smartphone regarding when your driverless car will pick you up. The vehicle could look very similar to some of the microbus concepts from Volkswagen. However, it would be completely configured for the purposes of the airline.
 
When you open the trunk and put your bags in, you will automatically check-in your bag. Owned by the airline, the car will be equipped to scan and label your bag. The cabin is TSA-approved meaning the identification process, as well as the body scan, can take place in the car. When you get out of the car at the airport, you will therefore already be security cleared and ready to depart. These new partnerships enable all sorts of streamlined processes that we haven’t seen before.”
 
 


The driverless restaurant

“Domino’s pizza has already installed built-in pizza ovens in all of their conventional cars. This marks the beginning of a completely new business model. Now we will see OEMs develop modular platforms where companies can request driverless cars customized to their needs.
 
Experience style restaurants could be promising concepts. Imagine this: An autonomous vehicle picks up you and your date. The dinner then takes place inside the car as you cruise along the coast. An exclusive experience – but also fairly inexpensive as the vehicle could be used for other purposes during the day. A more democratized version would be that the meal is prepared in advance, then served in the car before heading off. In a higher-end version, the chef could actually prepare the meal right in front of you. Here, you would obviously need specific air conditioning and storage areas for the food.
 
These restaurant models are dependent on technology that has not yet become the focus of carmakers. For a standing type of environment, there is a lot of stabilization needed. Once it will be technologically possible to isolate your platform from the movement around you then these scenarios will become reality.”
 
 


The trip is the driverless appointment

“You will be able to go to the tailor, see the doctor, meet your accountant – without visiting that person anymore. They will show up where you are and take you where you need to go. If you are driving home after work, you could use that time to take care of your finances or see your dentist. If your trip is 45 minutes to an hour, there will be plenty of time to get things done. In an autonomous car, you can have complete privacy with your doctor or your accountant inside the vehicle. They are not paid to drive, they are professionals that use the space as their office – with the additional benefit of taking you to your destination.
 
Dynamic scheduling – which is already used by ride-hailing services like Uber – will keep a doctor completely busy during the day, while you will no longer have to wait in a waiting room. Also consider the increasing role of telepresence in health care. Imagine a car that is equipped with everything that is needed for a reliable teleconference as well as certain medical equipment: you could visit your doctor and he wouldn’t even need to physically be there.”
 
 


Go to sleep in a driverless car and wake up in Vegas

“Autonomous cars will dramatically impact short-haul air travel. Most of us would prefer to go to sleep and wake up somewhere else. If you take a plane, the airport eats at least two hours of your time plus the duration of the flight. An autonomous car on the other hand would simply show up in the evening and take you to your destination while you sleep in a comfortable bed. Your journey could even end in a place where you could take a shower, freshen up – and you’re ready to go. There would be no waste of time.
 
On a different note on saving time – a revolutionary new sort of economy could come into play once all vehicles are connected: paying to get somewhere faster than other people. If it’s important to me, I am willing to spend more money. My car is now paying other cars in front of me to get out of my way. If it’s not important to me to get to a certain place in a certain time, I would be okay to be set back in line: as long as I am paid, that’s great. Somebody could choose to pay me two dollars to pass me. Their car is going to come up behind me, see that I am offering the ability to pass me for a buck and a digital transaction will take place.”
 
 


New mobility for elderly people

“Japan is already experimenting with self-driving vehicles to keep elderly people mobile and active. This could really change mobility for that part of the population – and for children as well. For both ends of the age spectrum, you have a very different set of requirements. The entrance needs to be addressed, the way that the vehicle moves – and the equipment in the car. Electric monitoring is becoming very pervasive. Take for instance technology that detects the drowsiness of the driver by checking blinking features and facial expressions with a camera. Meanwhile, Ford is experimenting with heart-rate sensors implemented into the seat.
 
Equally important is the way a vehicle communicates information to its passenger to create trust. We recently worked on a concept using screens on the outside of the vehicle to identify the rider. So the screen would say: ´Hi Warren, welcome to your car`. Speed, oil level – data that is interesting to the person behind the wheel: that’s fading away. So now the HMI has to give you a set of human information: ´Hi Warren, let’s go to the supermarket. Your journey is going to take ten minutes.` Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft are already offering the option to share your trip data with the people you care about – a crucial factor when children or elderly people use self-driving vehicles.”

            photo: Shiva Kumar
          





""Autonomous vehicles, whether people agree or disagree, are bound to happen. The only question left to answer is when?""
 
Shiva Kumar is a man who understands the concept of 'the consumer' better than most.
 
A former investment banker, now executive vice president for Ridecell, the leading platform provider for shared and autonomous mobility operators. From humble beginnings in 2009, the platform now powers new mobility offerings all over the world, focusing on ride sharing. This includes ZITY by Renault and Ferrovial, and GIG Car Share by AAA Northern California, Nevada and Utah.
 
Shiva's speciality is finance, but it's also business development or, as he calls it, ""strategically–optimising the assets"" of fleet companies – including the budding autonomous ones, once they start publicly operating.
 
""Ridecell enables these companies to optimise their assets, whether it is non-autonomous or autonomous, in terms of revenue share, as well as both improving their productivity and reducing their cost.""
 
In other words, he's a very good person to speak to regarding the impending autonomous revolution and how it will impact on the consumer, the market and the companies using the tech.
 
15 per cent of your life back
The benefits of driverless tech have long been apparent – and they aren't lost on Shiva. His passion on what autonomous vehicles could bring to each of us as individuals is clear:
 
""In the US alone, people spend two hours just commuting back and forth from work on average, which is approximately 10 to 15 per cent of their waking time – a significant portion. If you can unlock that time, make it more useful, whether it is through work, connecting with their friends and families or something else, autonomous vehicles will bring those benefits. Think of it as 15 per cent of additional life that you are getting at a younger age, where you are free to choose how you want to spend it, and that is very powerful.""
 
As with any new technology of this magnitude, it's going to cause some significant market disruptions – something Shiva is fully embracing with his sudden career change.
 
""When I started my career, I began at a start-up that was later acquired by Intel. I always thought I would be in a start-up or a 'disruptive' company. Longer-term wanted to be part of a company that is disrupting the whole value chain and Ridecell is a perfect example of that"".
 
However, there could be a significant shift in how autonomous technology is consumed – moving away from the typical ‘consumer buys vehicle’ structure and into something completely different.







            photo: ridecell.com
          





The consumer triangle
There are three factors to consider, whenever thinking about 'the consumer' in relation to the use of vehicles: the speed, the price and the convenience. Different situations will call for different priorities in this regard. Comfort is crucial for a long, leisurely road trip, but speed is the key for the commute. For some, the only thing that matters is sticking to the budget – which means speed and convenience are just a bonus.
 
Of course, convenience is a huge factor when it comes to vehicle use and ownership. It is debatably the strongest, and potentially only, argument against public transport – but it comes at a very literal cost. This is something that the rise of autonomous tech could change up, and fast, especially as the convenience element is covered by its 'door-to-door' nature.
 
""I don't believe consumers will buy driverless cars. It is more likely they will rely on driverless but primarily the vehicles will be bought and operated by fleets. The autonomous vehicle promises to at least bring the operating cost from $2 per mile to about 30 to 40 cents per mile, which is a huge saving from a price perspective.""
 
But, aside from projected savings in cost, there may be an upside in terms of speed too. Far more than the time when cars were largely owned by the people driving them.
 
""Most congestion happens because of the human driver, which results in traffic backlog. Autonomous vehicles, given that they’re machines, can be operated at much shorter distances. This means the space between the cars will be a lot narrower and much more methodical and disciplined.""
 
So, that's the entire consumer trifecta ticked off – driverless could easily be much better than the alternatives in each. Traditionally, the consumer has almost exclusively steered the market in terms of how vehicles are designed, manufactured, marketed and sold – but soon, they may be powered by the needs and wants of the fleet operators instead.
 
""Ultimately, the power still lies with the consumer. But it's otherwise shifting from the OEMs [original equipment manufacturer] to gig companies such as Uber and Lyft, where they understand on a consumer-by-consumer basis what kind of experiences are expected. The value is then going to be accrued by those intermediary companies who understand the customer needs and provide those customised experiences through various forms of transportation.""







            photo: ridecell.com
          





The autonomous future
As we already know, the technology is most of the way there. But there's still a very long way to go. Although, according to Shiva, the only question left to answer is not 'if' or 'how', but 'when'?
 
""I think we're looking at about eight to 10 years on the timeline. There are lots of things that have to happen. The first thing is, of course, the technology itself – but the second is the supporting regulation, and that can take time. Regulatory boards are notoriously conservative, so that will be the biggest challenge.""
 
Is the future in fleet, or do you think it'll remain firmly consumer-focused? Join the debate and make your voice heard.

Whether it’s news about big manufacturers, stories about how driverless could be put to good use or our own research into the myths that still surround the topic, we’re always digging deeper into the tech behind the concept.
 
But as the reality of the challenges we face on the road to level 5 automation has set in, and the ambition we saw perhaps five years ago has scaled back to set more realistic targets, our attention is turning to acceptance. Without it, self-driving will never find its place on our roads. Now, a new Mobility Study from Continental Automotive is providing some answers. We couldn’t wait to take a closer look.
 
Exploring the data
 
The latest Mobility Study from Continental is the sixth the manufacturing giant has conducted, asking people in Germany, France, the USA, China and Japan about various aspects of mobility. While the first stage focused on how Covid-19 impacted mobility habits, the second stage, conducted in October 2020, took a closer look at in-car technological development.
 
It’s this part of the study which has provided some interesting insight on the topic of automated travel as respondents were asked about their general attitude toward automotive mobility, their openness to various driver assistance systems and technological functions, as well as their willingness to share mobility data.
 
On these topics, the study drew plenty of data, but one of the most exciting is the fact that driver assistance systems and automated driving are gaining acceptance worldwide. As we might expect, and have discussed previously, openness to driverless tech is high in China and Japan. But people in Germany, France and the USA are more open than we might have thought, though they continue to have a ‘wait-and-see’ attitude.
 characters and blinking LED ‘eyes’. Perhaps this shows how, as driverless become more common, AVs might become real ‘characters’ in our lives from an early age.






      Image: Continental 2021
    




A global divide
 
Many of this study’s findings align with our own research. They found, for example, that though new technologies are of interest to drivers, fully giving up control is still unimaginable for many people. We tend to sit at the wheel of our cars out of conviction, and as our research in Germany showed, we’re apprehensive about losing the joy of driving which comes with manual control.
 
That said, the level to which we feel apprehensive about, or even fearful of, autonomous tech varies according to location. In the USA, fear is a significant factor. There, 75% of respondents are concerned about automated driving, a figure which is unchanged since 2018.
 
Elsewhere, driverless is seen as a natural progression. In France, for example, 40% expect to see AVs in the near future and in China and Japan the outlook is even more positive. An impressive 91% of respondents in China and 82% in Japan consider automated driving to be a useful development and a majority in both countries expect AVs to become a permanent feature in the next five to 10 years.
 
While that divide is significant, and will likely have an impact on how AVs are rolled out globally, there is a consensus across the surveyed countries when considering arguments against automated driving. Around 80% of all respondents agree that legislation is yet to create the right framework for technical development and call for established guiding principles to integrate AVs into daily road traffic. Acceptance might vary, but the issues with delivering a driverless future are constant worldwide.
 
Control and driver assistance systems
 
Levels of acceptance globally can also be gleaned from responses to driver assistance systems. Generally, the study discovered that the technological possibilities in terms of automated driving are far more advanced than the current willingness of drivers to use them.
 
For driver assistance systems, the story is different. Across all five countries, drivers are open to their use, especially when it comes to safety-related functions. As Frank Petznick, head of the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems business unit at Continental, explains, “The high level of confidence in driver assistance systems indicates that as these become more widespread, confidence in automated driving will automatically grow.
 
“Our experience has shown that acceptance increases as people get to know and understand the functions in question. Extensive testing is therefore key. This should be carried out in real-life traffic conditions in order to understand how people interact with the systems. In turn, this will provide important findings that can be incorporated into the further development of the technology.”






      Image: Frank Petznick, Continental 2021
    




Our route forward?
 
The road to trusted AVs may therefore run through the development of technologically advanced and trusted driver assistance systems. In particular, the demand for safety-related systems suggests that there is space in the market for accident-reducing AVs, though some hurdles around acceptance remain in place.
 
That said, this study reveals that more and more drivers are seeing benefits in self-driving. Scepticism remains, especially in Europe and the USA, and there is work to be done if manufacturers hope to overcome this hesitancy. Still, fewer than ever are completely closed off to the concept.

Sebastian Thrun, Google VP turned CEO of flying vehicle start up Kitty Hawk, last year said that we can expect autonomy in the skies before it is delivered on our roads. Vertical take off and the relative scarcity of obstacles in our airspace means autonomous flight is somewhat simpler than autonomous navigation on roads where other cars, pedestrians, buildings and all sorts of unexpected objects must be avoided. Launching flying cars is surely the first step, and the race to do just that is proceeding apace.

Flying cars enter the testing phase
Just like driverless vehicles, flying vehicles have seemed more at home in the world of science fiction than in reality, but that is changing incredibly quickly. While no flying vehicle of this type is in operation just yet, plenty are in development with major manufacturers. Uber and Hyundai have recently paired up to develop a flying taxi, and have already completed and displayed models of their concept. Japanese company Sky Drive has launched the first manned test flight this year, and analysts with Morgan Stanley have recently predicted that flying taxis will be commonplace by 2040. Uber plans to beat that, committing to spend $1.5 billion (€1.27 billion) in the sector by 2025 and hoping to launch a flying taxi service as soon as 2023.
Though many tend to talk about ‘flying cars’, these vehicles, which bear little resemblance to common cars, are more accurately described as eVTOLs (electric vertical take-off and landing). At the moment, an impressive 38% of eVTOL projects are in the flight-testing stage and several have now reached the stage where they’ll be certified by local and national authorities, just awaiting confirmation of whether they’ll be permitted for personal and commercial use. It’s not an entirely new concept – flying taxis were tested in Dubai back in 2017 – but eVTOLs look set to become a much more common sight over the next few years.

What will flying cars be used for?
 
We might have visions of fleets of flying taxis or dream of beating the traffic in our own flying vehicle, but most predict the reality will be a little different. The commercial market is likely to be the first to use flying vehicles in any major way. According to a 2020 report from Ehang, a world-leader in autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), logistics and shipping will dominate the market. Smart city management and aerial media solutions will play large roles too.
But we shouldn’t disregard the use case for passenger transportation. When up and running, flying taxi services like that proposed by Uber could offer exceptionally speedy service, without the price tag you might expect. According to Uber’s Eric Allison, they predict the service will cost around £4.24 (€ 4.68) per mile, just 64p (71 cents) more than the average London taxi. And with many willing to pay a premium to escape traffic even now, it seems likely that the service will take off.

That inevitably leads us onto the question of cost. Though the cost to ride in an eVTOL may be minimal, the cost of ownership ranges massively. According to Uswitch, a first-generation flying car could cost as little as £95,000 (€104,780) – about the same as a high-end Porsche – but this stretches upwards to £443,000 (€488,602) and beyond.
 
The look and feel of these flying vehicles cover a wide range too. Most still look a little drone-like at the moment, but some start ups are working on sleeker designs and many offer the ‘wheels and wings’ combination that’s been resting in our collective imagination.
 
Specification is another area where we can spot big differences. Where the 3-seater Terrafugia TF-X maxes out at 100mph (160km/h), the more expensive 4-seater Moller Skycar 400 can reach speeds of up to 330mph (531km/h). Price is inevitably linked to capability, as is the way with most forms of transport, but here there seems to exist more variation for similar products than in the case of autonomous road vehicles. Whether this will stabilise with time and the development of a secure market for the tech is yet to be seen.
 
 
So, are we ready to hop aboard flying taxis?
Just as we’ve seen with driverless cars, being interested in the development of a seemingly futuristic technology doesn’t necessarily mean we trust it. A 2019 study in which Deloitte asked a global focus group their thoughts on eVTOLs proved as much. A majority 80% had fears about their safety, but at the same time, 50% saw the tech as a viable solution to easing increasing congestion.
 
The development is certainly an interesting one and could present a solution to a whole host of transportation issues which stem from congestion and the limitations imposed by highway systems. But as the field develops, it will undoubtedly become more complex too. Though airspace is relatively easy to navigate right now, that cannot remain the same with a high volume of flying vehicles.
 
The development of autonomous flying transport will change the landscape once more, as might the increasing development of autonomous vehicles which can safely navigate our roads. Might passengers not feel safer on the ground than in the air, regardless of the technology behind their vehicle? Right now it is difficult to know, but we’re certainly interested to find out.
 
 
We always love to hear your thoughts. Would you be happy to hop aboard a flying taxi? Or do you think the tech is best used for commercial interests? Would you go so far as to buy your own? Let us know in the comments below.

It seems near impossible to talk about driverless cars without another emerging tech cropping up: electric. For a long time, the two technologies have been linked as green travel solutions. Where autonomous cars promise increased efficiency, electric vehicles promise reduced emissions in our cities (though the ecological impact of battery production is far from perfect) and so many have assumed the two would launch in tandem.
 
Similar goals have been set for both technologies too. Though the progress of AVs is falling behind early predictions  Professor Nick Reed, a transport consultant involved in UK self-driving trials, explains, “Reality is setting in about the challenges and complexity,” but driverless could still be here by 2025. The shift to electric is expected to be equally challenging, but governments and manufacturers across the world have plans in place. Norway has put a ban on new petrol vehicle sales from 2025, the UK from 2030, California from 2035 and there are incentives to make the switch across Europe. Plus, companies with an interest in driverless tech are pledging their commitment to electric too – Lyft has promised to be all electric by 2030, and Uber plans to follow in 2040. So, are the two technologies intrinsically linked? Or will the shift to driverless vehicles be simpler than that to fully electric transport?

Will driverless cars be electric?
Electric vehicles are limited by the distance they can travel between charges and driverless functionality, which requires a significant amount of power, reduces this range even further. Bulky lidar and cameras on the car’s exterior, though essential for driverless capability, impact aerodynamics – researchers from a recent Carnegie Mellon University project have found this alone could reduce range by 5-10%.
 
Yet there is still room for hope. Though autonomous features do risk reducing range and degrading batteries through fast charging of electric vehicles, those same researchers are sure that smarter software and hardware tweaks could make the technologies integrate smoothly. Venkat Viswanathan, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, adds, “We’re getting to a point where we won’t need to choose between autonomous driving and electric cars.”
 
 
Are hybrid models the answer to combining driverless and electric tech?
At the moment, hybrid looks like the best option for most OEMs. As Jim Farley, Ford CEO, explained back in 2017, “Hybrids help provide the significant amount of electrical power required for self-driving sensors and computing systems without having a significant impact on the mileage.”
 
Essentially, hybrids will give OEMs the opportunity to launch AVs sooner than if they were to wait for fully electric vehicles to be ready. Argo’s Bryan Salesky explains that it’s all about economics. “The way we look at it,” he says, “hybrids make sense in the very near term and then, as battery technology improves as we can put more and more battery power. We can phase in the fully electric vehicle.”
 
Many are committed to mastering this all-electric solution – batteries which supply greater range with less degradation and more efficient self-driving hardware are both in development. Plus, solid state batteries, which replace the liquid electrolyte in lithium-ion batteries with a solid one, look like a promising solution. They have a lower carbon footprint and pack up to 10 times more power, meaning less weight and more miles per charge. Toyota plan to debut one this year, but mass production is still a way off.
 
Another possible solution might be fuel cell technology. Hydrogen has been discussed as the ideal zero-carbon fuel for some time, but it has only recently started to become a viable option for manufacturers. By 2025, Toyota believe hydrogen cars will cost the same to produce as hybrids and the Hydrogen Council, an organisation made up of 92 major companies, claims the 2020s will be “the decade of hydrogen”. Hybrids, then, may not be the best option for much longer.

Autonomy takes priority
Many major OEMs are, by necessity, committed to electric. It’s evident that electric vehicles are the future of automotive and that’s evidenced in the fact that major manufacturers like Volkswagen are retooling factories to build EVs and companies like Daimler are shifting their focus from car production to the tech arena. But there also seems to be an awareness that, to see AVs become a reality in the near future, we can’t link autonomous and electric tech too closely.

For most, this means staying open to both hybrid and electric options. Waymo, for example, are developing their self-driving tech with both the fully electric Jaguar i-pace and Chrysler Pacifica hybrids. To meet the latest predictions – Ford aims to get AVs on the road in 2022 and Volkswagen want AVs on sale by 2025 – electric may just not be possible. And as they scale up, infrastructure, particularly the availability of fast charging points, will become an even greater problem.
 
If autonomy is to take priority, we may transition to a driverless future before a fully electric one is realised. That said, it’s clear the intention to make autonomous and electric technology work together seamlessly is there. We’ll just have to wait a few years longer to see it in action.
 
We’re always eager to hear what you think. Would you rather see an electric AV than a hybrid one? Do you think EVs, not AVs, should be manufacturers’ priority? Share your thoughts in the comments below.

Automation and autonomy are exciting concepts, full of potential in any and every sector. But, for certain industries, they pose just as many drawbacks as they do opportunities. At least, they do according to the people who will be working with them.
At the 2017 Agritechnica, the international trade fair for agricultural tech, the technology company Continental presented some exciting new solutions for farmers. Among the many new technologies, there were a few nods to the emerging field of agricultural autonomy. It was widely heralded as the 'future of farming', throughout the trade fair – something which has only accelerated in the two years since.
 

Are you interested in other industries that could benefit from automation and driverless vehicles in the future? Read our article ""The race to autonomous shipping"".

But what about the people who will be using this new technology? After all, it's their lives, and their worlds, this technology will affect.
To find out, we speak to three of these very people, who come from two very different farming backgrounds.

The Pastures
Gary Trueman is an ex-dairy farmer and agricultural contractor who now owns a pasture holding in Spalding, Lincolnshire. He believes further automation, and autonomy, is ""impossible to avoid"". But, before it can happen, changes need to be made, with safety as a primary concern:
""When supervised to some degree, such as the tethering systems we already see today, or on its own working a field – yes, I would trust autonomous vehicles and machines to be safe. Operating on its own in a crew yard or on the road? No. Not yet, at least.""
In terms of impact, on business and the economy, he is somewhat sceptical:
""Big corporate farms will likely embrace any new technology if it helps increase profits in some way. Smaller farms will have technology fed down to them over, most likely, decades, so the impact will be slower. As for the economy, considering farming is on its knees at the moment – autonomous systems would need to be able to improve yield to have a positive effect. I’m not sure that’s possible.""
 
The Livestock
Timothy Berry, an organic beef farmer and former dairy farmer from Devonshire, UK, does not trust autonomous farming machines and equipment to be safe, and has fears that its introduction will mean less need for manual labourers. But he does believe there is an opportunity for larger businesses:
""Self-driven vehicles will be helpful with larger industrial-sized farms, but for smaller family farms, the financial implications would make this a no-go for most. This could lead to a huge divide between large industrial farms and smaller niche farms specialising in particular methods.""
He is also concerned about the environmental impact of agricultural autonomy:
""There will probably be a negative impact on soil structures and more tech introduced into valuable countryside, with more powerlines and mechanical infrastructure.""
However, for those working on the farms, there may be an upside in terms of working hours. Although how that time saved is spent is very dependent on the individuals:
""They will be spending less time in the cab, which means more social time.""

The flowers and fields
Debbie Vale is an established horticulturalist, educated by the Royal Horticultural Society. She is also a multi-disciplined farmer, with nine years of experience maintaining agricultural holdings for both crops and livestock in both the UK and New Zealand. 
She has already seen some significant changes in her line of work, including some big leaps in what technology makes possible in the day-to-day lives of farmers:
""The breakthroughs in technology have been incredible. It is possible to fully program some of the machinery we use with the help of an onboard computer, GPS signalling and onboard cameras. We have already used drones to herd sheep, too.""
But what could be the impact of this technology becoming fully autonomous?
""From a business point of view, it would be very productive. Less would be spent on wages if vehicles replaced people.""
""Driverless help could mean shorter working days. This could free up time to focus on green spaces. Farmers in America are already planting crops in circles and leaving the space left over wild to create a haven for wildlife. This is hugely important with the current bee problem.""
More time for agricultural workers and experts leading to more conservation-lead activities would be most welcome in the agricultural sector, as many of them are increasingly concerned about the future:
""If we do not look after the fine balance needed for beneficial insects, it would have a devastating effect on food production. We are at a critical time in history where, if we do not start to reverse the damage done to the environment, we will lose a huge percentage of wildlife and thus the food available.""

The future of farming
Agritechnica 2019 kicks off in Hanover in November. There will be even more autonomous exhibits on display than in previous years. But, as Gary points out, it's very important to look to the people before we look to the machines, to see how they want to be helped:
""Talk to the people that will be using them. That way, you give farmers what they need not what you think they need.""
After all, it’s the farmers who know the land. Without them, and without agriculture, there isn't much of a future for any of us.

Do you think a more autonomous agricultural sector will help or hinder the people who will use it?

Science Fiction is, some would say, exactly that: fiction. Pure escapism, where your wildest dreams – or at least the wildest dreams of the authors, artists and directors – can be safely explored. It’s also a place of inspiration back in the real world, especially where vehicles are considered.
 
It was in this wild, limitless space that the concept of driverless vehicles, with no limits to technology or supporting infrastructure, was first played with. But it wouldn’t be long before the real world started catching up, as I was quick to discover when I – quite literally - immersed myself in a director’s vision of our technological future.
 


TAKE IT AWAY, SPIELBERG: ONSET FOR READY PLAYER ONE
Picture this: it's the summer of 2016, nearly three years ago. The streets of Birmingham, UK, are lined with flaming dustbins and burned-out cars. People wander from place to place, with VR (virtual reality) masks strapped to their heads. They each spend most of their time in a global virtual world in a bid to escape the harsh realities of the dystopia they are living in. I am one of those people.
 
But here's the catch: they’re doing so for the benefit of the cameras. I am one of those people, an extra for Spielberg’s soon to be Sci-Fi hit: Ready Player One.
 
Based on the bestseller by Ernest Cline, the film explores, among other things, technology and innovation. Cars, and transport in general, are integral to the plot. In fact, the scenes I appeared in all featured cars in some way, with epic car chases forming the film’s finale being ‘set’ and ‘reset’ dozens of times. Tedious, but necessary for a perfectionist like Mr Spielberg. And, as anyone who has seen the final cut will tell you, it was worth the effort.
 


SELF-DRIVE SCI-FI: WHERE IT STARTED
Self-driving cars in films are nothing new. They feature heavily in Sci-Fi classics such as I, Robot(2004), Minority Report (2002), Total Recall (1990), The Fifth Element (1997) and even as far back as Knight Rider (1982), featuring K.I.T.T. – an artificially intelligent 1982 Pontiac Trans-AM. You could even argue that Herbie the ‘Love Bug’, the Volkswagen Beetle from the 60s, was a self-driving car.
 
Ready Player One, despite being set several decades in the future, contains a strong blend of technological and cultural influences from across the last few decades, with throwback references to the popular Sci-Fi films. This includes, for example, a virtual DeLorean DMC-12 which includes K.I.T.T. technology, essentially giving it driverless capabilities.
 
When those films hit the big screen, the concept of a car using AI to drive itself was considered not only improbable, but impossible. And yet, by the time Ready Player One was released in March 2018, driverless technology was not only a real and tangible thing – it was actively being considered, and tested, as the future of transport. Much in the same way that virtual reality is now a fact of everyday life, driverless cars are quickly following suit.
 
Soon, there may be no real need for that thrilling car chase, or their complicated set restarts. Everything will be driverless, in both the real world and out of it.

STRANGER THAN FICTION: FICTIONAL TECH IN THE REAL WORLD
Driverless cars are just the latest in a long list of examples of Sci-Fi becoming Sci-Fact as technology and infrastructure advance beyond the realms of the imagination. Let’s face it, it’s happened before – several times. 
 
Arguably, the earliest use of basic video phone technology appears in Fritz Lang’s Metropolis (1927). In 2011, Nike launched the limited-edition MAG trainer with self-adjusting laces, based on Marty McFly’s high tops in Back to the Future (1989).
 
Fast forward to this century, and to Minority Report (2002), which featured a form of ‘Heads up Display’. A similar style of touch display technology is currently being prototyped by the Taiwanese company ITRI. The same film also uses ‘gesture tech’, or ‘smart gloves’ much like current VR technology does today. Minority Report also featured the driverless Lexus 2054, which was designed by Lexus at the request of Spielberg, the director.
 
There are countless further examples of Sci-Fi becoming Sci-Fact to choose from, but my personal favourite has to be the development of the Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (TALOS) by the US military, based on Tony Stark’s titular Iron Man (2008) suit. TALOS features a battery-powered exoskeleton that reduces bodily impact and ‘in helmet’ comms.

WHAT NEXT?
Of course, this cycle of fiction influencing fact, and vice versa, will not stop there. Especially not where vehicles are concerned. The upcoming children’s film, Spies in Disguise, features an animated driverless car which was designed as a concept car by Audi. The fully-electric and fully-autonomous Audi RSQ e-tron will be ‘driven’ by the spy Lance Sterling, voiced by Will Smith.
 
This is the second time Audi has designed a concept car for the exclusive use of one of Smith’s films, with I, Robot featuring the ‘original’ RSQ. While both incarnations of the RSQ models will never become a physical reality, the technology is an aspiration of Audi’s, with the brand pledging to spend 14 billion Euros on making fully-driverless Audis a reality by 2023, and maybe sooner.
 
Audi aren’t running the driverless race alone. Tesla, BMW, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover are each investing significant amounts in bringing autonomous driving to the streets of our cities. Fiction is rapidly becoming fact, and there will soon be a time that a completely ‘manual’ car will be confined to the movies of the past.

Starting with magnetic tape-based localisation, they’ve progressed to more advanced and less restrictive autonomous technologies today. Real technical progress has been made to improve their performance. At the same time, the maturity of autonomous technology for light vehicles and public transport has increased sharply over the last five years to the extent that major car manufacturers, as well as internet giants, regularly announce new tests on open roads.
It is now possible to apply this autonomous technology to material handling operations. While regulation currently prevents public operations without drivers, private sites are the clear catalysts. This means the automation of vehicles dedicated to logistics flows will concretely move plants into Industry 4.0.
 
Building on successful experience in autonomous public transport, notably with the EZ10 shuttle, EasyMile recently introduced the TractEasy solution to the logistics market. It is the first autonomous tow tractor dedicated to material handling within a private site (for example a factory or a logistics centre), able to operate both inside and outside in a complex urban-like environment. This is why that changes the game completely:
 
 Automation in open outdoor environments
 
The technology that enables vehicles, for private or public transportation, to drive autonomously has been developed to meet environmental constraints in open outdoor environments. Negotiating a traffic light junction, navigating in the midst of other vehicles, giving priority to pedestrians at crossings, entering a roundabout and more are all interactions and events that are the norm when driving on public roads.
Extending the possibilities offered by the development of autonomous technology to logistics and industrial applications allows the automation of new logistics flows: the transport of goods between buildings on an industrial or logistics site (e.g. from the warehouse to the assembly line), including outdoors. 
 
Industrial and logistics applications also make it possible to develop certain functionalities, such as interior to exterior transitions (which are infrequent on public roads) or the interactions required to cross a railway track autonomously.

Adaptability is key
 
The evolution of the main sensors used for automation (lidar), as well as the appearance of powerful data fusion algorithms, have made it possible to get away from dedicated infrastructure for driverless operations. It is now possible for an autonomous vehicle to navigate relying on elements already present in the environment. For example, it is no longer necessary to install and maintain magnetic strips on the ground or reflectors on walls or posts. 
This makes it much easier and quicker to adapt operations when changing the configuration of logistics flows, whether permanent or temporary (for road works, for example). As the definition of trajectories is now a ‘simple’ software step, the intervention of a trained engineer – and tomorrow a technician – will allow the necessary modifications to be made and validated within a few hours.
 
Given the novelty of the technology and the relative complexity of the installation tools and methods, most installation and modification operations are currently carried out by the manufacturers themselves. The plan is to allow trained partners to carry out these operations in the near future in order to encourage autonomy, including for processes.
 
Optimisation of costs and productivity
 
A study by Sapio Research in 2019 on ‘Automation for Intralogistics’ showed that the key factors for automating logistics flows were improved productivity (48%) and lower operating costs (42%). This is based, in particular, on the feedback from the implementation of AGVs in warehouses. The autonomous vehicle technology will extend the scope of logistics flow automation, which will in turn improve overall operational efficiency and give early adopters a competitive advantage.
 
Automation also allows human activities to be refocused on higher value-added tasks. Considering the transportation of goods from point A to point B within a factory, the high value-added tasks lie in the operations at the goods loading/ unloading points. The automation of repetitive and low value-added tasks, such as the driving phases between points A and B, makes sense in the context of reduced margins and recruitment difficulties due to a lack of manpower to perform these tasks.
 
The applications for autonomous technology within the world of industrial logistics are numerous. Manufacturers, logisticians, and equipment distributors are very interested in understanding how to optimise their current processes and prepare for the future of logistics. The organisation of industrial logistics as we know it today will have to be rethought in view of the technological advances available and evolutions to come. From autonomous vehicles, tracking systems, warehouse management systems, and control towers, the opportunities on the cusp of changing the face of tomorrow’s logistics are plentiful.

Are we seeing the end of dealerships?
It is easy to see how virtual test driving could mark the end of dealerships as we know them. The numbers show that we’re not too keen on showrooms – a survey of 11,000 global customers revealed 64% would prefer to complete the entire transaction of buying a personal vehicle online and of millennials, who now make up 40% of new vehicle buyers, only 12% visit a dealership for research.
 
But everything seems to point to a changing experience rather than the end of dealerships. Showrooms will increasingly focus on experiences and it is virtual tech which will allow them to do this.
 
Just as Tesla changed the game by making stores a place to get a feel for cars before buying online, VR will allow small spaces to become flexible showrooms for endless models. Even if personal ownership drops off with automated driving, showrooms will still be the place to test out which car, and company, you’d like to ride with.
 
Dealerships will be all about experiences and those experiences will often come in the form of a VR headset. We may still buy cars in the future, but test drives will never be the same.
 
What do you think a test drive will look in 10 years? Have you already experienced a VR journey? Would you buy a car without ever getting in it? Let us know in the comments section, or join the debate on social media.

The sun has set, headlights are slowly flicking on, and the roads grow dark. Suddenly, a shape appears, causing a moment of mild panic and a jerk on the steering wheel. You’ve probably gotten away with this kind of maneuver many times during the day without thinking about it, but driving is more daunting – and dangerous – at night.

The figures hold this up. In the US, UK and EU, between 40-45% of fatal crashes happen in the dark, despite there being 60% less traffic on the road in some cases.  
 
Thanks to reduced visibility, the way we see the road ahead changes completely when it’s dark. Mix in drivers who could be more tired, potential adverse weather condition and a higher chance of drivers under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and it becomes clear why you’re statistically more likely to have a crash at night. 
 
Humans are to blame
Sadly, almost every reason for the increase in car accidents at night all boils down to our incapability to function as well at night. Human eyes aren't quite built for night-time activity, and our brains are hard-wired in the same way; when the sun is gone, it's time to stop concentrating and witch off until it rises. This chemical shut down is one of the leading causes of falling asleep at the wheel – something which 17% of drivers in the EU admitted to having experienced at least once before.Then there's our inability to deal with sudden changes in light sources. If you've driven past a car with their headlights on full beam, you'll notice that it takes your eyes a little while to adjust back to normal. For 15-year-olds, this takes about a second, but when you reach 65, it can take as long as nine seconds. That's a long time to go with an inaccurate picture of the road ahead.Even though we're easilythe leading cause of vehicle accidents in the dark, it's not practical to simply stop driving at night. Luckily, there may be a solution to significantly reducing road fatalities both at night and during the day.

Driverless cars in the dark 
Vehicular autonomy is becoming more and more prevalent. We have electric cars capable of taking the wheel and comfortably navigating from A to B on highways both at any time of the day, and autonomous public transport is appearing on public roads. There are initiatives in Oslo, Norway and Tokyo, Japan acting as autonomous role models for other congested cities around the world. 
 
Although partly automated vehicles can be bought in many markets right now, the actual level of automation they offer is still limited. This means that drivers still need to constantly monitor the drive and must be ready to resume control immediately. On some models, night driving is still a hard no, with the car forcing the driver to take manual control if the light dips below a certain level.
 
However, instead of relying on just a camera or just a radar, driverless vehicles are deploying integrated state of the art system technology to improve the capabilities of autonomous vehicles when driven at night.

Many autonomous vehicle developers and manufacturers are turning additionally to LiDAR, a laser-based radar system that sends pulses of light in front of the car. An on-board computer then builds a much more accurate picture of the road ahead in a split second, even without any light sources. Ford have recently trialled this technology, showing that safer autonomous driving at night is a serious focus for the major manufacturers working towards fully self-driven vehicles. Technology company Continental have also developed a high-res 3D LiDAR, described as 'the future of machine vision' for a range of uses, including for mining – a notoriously dark industry. 
 
The beauty of using LiDAR as an addition to a 2D camera and a radar or even the human eye is the system’s ability to see further than both, even in pitch blackness. The system can see pretty much anything up to 250 metres ahead of the vehicle, which outperforms the human eye quite considerably. There’s also the fact that the system can spot, calculate and make a critical decision in time measured in thousandths of a second, whereas a tired brain could make the decision to swerve around an obstacle when it’s too late. There’s also the fact that LiDAR sensors don’t need to close their eyelids every four to six seconds – and we all know that road accidents frequently happen in the blink of an eye.
 
It seems that a combination of different sensors  is the future for autonomous driving in the dark, which is great news for those who don’t enjoy driving at night – simply hand over the ominous task of avoiding drunk drivers, unlit cyclists and pedestrians and parked cars over to technology that is used to helping the military, and miners, see in the dark!

Autonomous vehicles - Better than us? 
 
The key takeaway from driverless cars operating at night goes way beyond the practical implications and safety concerns that still need to be navigated. In reality, AI doesn’t get tired, doesn’t mistake a parked car for a patch of empty road and can make split-second decisions infinitely faster than a tired brain thinking about what’s for dinner. 
 
In order to reduce the almost 25,300 car-related fatalities that occurred in Europe last year, a leap of faith is needed to trust driverless cars to do a better job. 
 
And with technology catching up, and in many cases outstripping human capabilities when it comes to driving in the dark, it’s high time we put our faith in driverless vehicles. For our own sakes. 
 
Do you agree that autonomous cars could be a safer option at night? Or is human judgement and better night-time driving education a better solution? Join the debate and tell us your thoughts on autonomous vehicles.

The auto industry stands to benefit greatly with the growth of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly with the emergence of self-driving cars. We are already seeing partially automated cars with driverless features, the likes of which are unanimously making driving easier and safer. Parking, collision detection and auto-braking features, in particular, are proving popular additions to new cars – and are changing the way customers choose their vehicles.
But tech-features and customer behaviors aren't the only things that autonomy is likely to overhaul. Here are four other changes that self-driving cars could bring to the auto industry.
 






      Image: inverse.com
    




1. Tech companies could take over
Auto manufacturers have a tendency to drag their feet when it comes to adopting new technologies. For proof, look no further than the length of time it took before the industry to fully embraced electric cars. Now tech companies, as opposed to traditional manufacturers, are gradually making inroads into auto development and manufacturing. Google and Apple, for example, are already experimenting with autonomous driving technology – and startups are already taking the sector by storm. Traditional car manufacturing companies are under pressure up their game, lest they be edged out from their own industry.

2. Better car warranty terms
You could soon be paying less for your car warranty thanks to the zero-incident future that driverless cars are likely to bring. Once these cars become affordable to the lower-middle class, human-driven cars will be a thing of the past and city authorities will have to design better, smarter roads. The roads and the cars will be communicating through camera technology and sensors, which will make pathways smooth and collisions nonexistent. 
When this happens, car sellers will have no reason not to prolong car warranties. There is a high chance that no car will need expensive repairs within the period in which the warranty is in force, after all. In fact, the only maintenance practices car owners will need to do to keep their warranty, is ensure their software is up to date.

3. The cybersecurity factor
Many things will be greatly improved once autonomous cars are fully integrated into our transportation system, but that is not to mean that everything will be. Outdated car software, for example, will be vulnerable to cyber criminality, which means that cybersecurity experts will become very relevant in the auto industry. The communication interfaces on our roads will also be vulnerable to hacking, rendering zero-incident roads a pipedream. 
If a malicious cyber attacker were to gain access to the servers used to direct autonomous vehicles, and goes ahead to confuse them all, they could cause confusion and even fatal accidents of tragic proportions. In the event the road network in a city is compromised, a huge amount of private user data would be up for grabs too, resulting in identity theft – and worse.
For the reasons above, all stakeholders in the auto and transportation industries will need to employ robust, appropriate, and foolproof data security solutions. 






      Image: drp group
    




4. The ridesharing business will boom
The ridesharing business will grow tremendously with the adoption of autonomous cars. Uber and Lyft are already making notable strides in the transportation sector, partially because people trust in their efficiency over that of public transportation. This efficiency will only improve with driverless tech. Autonomous cars will necessitate low maintenance costs, so ridesharing services will be cheaper for the consumer and highly profitable for the provider – therefore worth the investment.

The world’s first automated, unmanned railway commenced operation in 1981 and the Japanese line has since become an inspiration around the world. Now, almost 50 cities run fully automated lines, with more under construction.
 
 
Automation is already here
For many, automation still feels like the technology which defines our future, but it has a big role in our past and present too. While we’ve been waiting for AVs to arrive, we’ve been using elevators and riding in airplanes which already operate independently of human control. In fact, elevators have offered us driverless travel since the 1920s and the majority of time spent flying is under the control of a machine.

Though the very basics of autonomous tech are similar across planes, trains and road vehicles – in that they all sense, plan and act – their environments couldn’t be more different. That is why autonomous trains provide such a good opportunity for driverless tech, as the environments in which they operate can be controlled.
 
Firstly, trains run on tracks which means their routes are pre-determined. Obstacles may still pose a problem, but most autonomous lines remove these by ensuring access to the track itself is limited. The Chuo Shinkansen line in Japan, for example, incorporates screens designed to keep people and obstacles away from tracks. When it opens in 2027, it will be the world’s fastest unmanned railway and so such preventative measures are of vital importance – should something go wrong, there is very little time to correct it.
 
However, not all autonomous lines are being newly built. Adapting older stations is a must, echoing the idea that AVs will drive alongside human-driven vehicles on our roads. In Paris, on metro lines which are over 100 years old in places, this process is already well underway with over half of all stations now ready for the anticipated arrival of autonomous trains later this year. But what level of autonomy can we expect on the railway?
 
 
Grades of automation (GoA) in trains
Much as we can categorise driverless cars by their  , the International Association of Public Transport measures the capabilities of driverless trains in a graded system ranging from GoA 0 (with no automation) to GoA 4 (fully autonomous). These can be broken down as:
 
GoA 0: Trains have no automatic functionalities and are manually operated at all times, relying on a driver to interpret visual cues in order to run safely.
 
GoA 1: Drivers are still responsible for functions like starting, stopping and operating doors, and must take over in case of emergency, but automatic functions can control speed and signals.
 
GoA 2: At this grade, we see the beginnings of autonomy. A driver sits in the cab and is responsible for door operation and obstacle detection, but the train can move from station to station without intervention.
 
GoA 3: Trains can run between stations and operate doors autonomously. The ‘driver’, much like the stewards who are present in almost all autonomous cabs, is only needed to take over in emergency situations – a good example of this is London’s Docklands Light Railway.
 
GoA 4: At the top grade, trains operate independently, even in emergencies. This is a common set-up for automated metro lines like the ones in Paris, Sydney and Barcelona.
 
 
How does autonomous rail travel compare to autonomous driving? 
Among the higher levels of automation, there are benefits for both individuals and businesses when using autonomous trains. Passengers can experience faster journeys thanks to the increased efficiency of trains which can react to change at speed, travel closer together and operate 24/7. Cost of travel could also decrease as autonomous trains can operate for 70% less than the cost of human-driven ones. Even if staff remain on board and in stations, operation costs drop by an impressive 30%.
 
This is perhaps where trains and road vehicles differ most. Though similar savings, which range from a 29-45% reduction in cost, have been predicted for autonomous haulage vehicles, driverless passenger vehicles cannot boast such benefits. However, the real value for private users comes with having free time during the rather comfortable ride.  
 
It is therefore in the industrial movement of goods that autonomy has most benefits. Technology giant GE agree that when it comes to automation, the money’s in freight and mass transportation including trucks, trains and ships, not personal vehicles.

Autonomous haulage vehicles are starting to take huge steps forward. Recently, American company TuSimple has expanded operations and hopes to be shipping across the US in autonomous trucks by 2024. In Germany, Continental has already launched trials of trucks with level 4 autonomy and we’re seeing the same pattern on railways too.
 
Australia was the first when in 2018, the first heavy freight rail run carried 28,000 tonnes of iron ore over 280km from mine to port. Similar systems have since been trialled in the US, the UK, France, the Czech Republic and more, with many hoping to see some automation in action for heavy industry as soon as 2023.
 
So though autonomous tech is already common in rail travel, it is only recently that we’ve begun to see mass expansion across both passenger and industrial systems. This, perhaps, teaches a valuable lesson for the progression of autonomous road vehicles. AVs may be on their way, but it could be some time before we find their most beneficial uses and it’s likely these won’t be in passenger transport.
 
We’re always eager to hear what you think. Have you ridden in an autonomous train? Do you get an eerie feeling in a driverless train or do you actually feel safer? Let us know in the comments below.

OEMs, governments, technology companies and more all make leaps forward with big ideas, growing expertise and even legislative changes. That variety, however, does mean that progress can be stalled as each organization explores separate routes to the same goal. A lack of collaboration and communication slows things down.
 
In Germany, the opposite is happening. That’s thanks to the National Platform Future of Mobility. Bringing together experts from across the industry, NPM acts as a hub for dialogue around how transport should and will develop over the coming years.
 
As one central platform for the discussion of transport more broadly, it presents opportunities to bring together technical, legal and social thinking, working out problems and presenting solutions which can benefit the entire industry and, ultimately, end consumers. For us at 2025AD, that’s a fascinating proposition, and one we’re eager to learn more about.

What are the platform’s objectives? 
The platform has four broad goals:

to develop solutions for an environmentally friendly transport system integrating different means of transport
to ensure a competitive automotive industry
to enable efficient, high-quality, flexible, safe and affordable mobility
to promote Germany as a location for employment in the transport industry

Though each has a separate purpose, taken together these aims describe an organization with ambitions for safe, efficient, environmentally conscious travel which is open to all and has benefits beyond transport itself.
 
Its six working groups drill down into these issues further and make recommendations for action which can ignite real change in automotive and beyond. A few of these – ‘Standardization, norms, certification and type approval’, ‘Digitization for the mobility sector’ and ‘Alternative drive technologies and fuels for sustainable mobility’ – are particularly important when it comes to the progress of driverless tech in Germany. All could look to autonomous solutions to achieve their aims and implement green, futureproof transport.
 
 
Does this center Germany in driverless development? 
As a major hub for automotive, Germany seems to be a natural home for such a forward-thinking platform centering on the development of transport systems. Its links with several well established and well-respected OEMs also makes Germany an inevitable center for autonomous technology – the fact its already legalizing autonomous driving systems makes that plain.

Moving forward, brand will come to play an increasingly important role in wider acceptance of driverless technologies. Car brands, it’s been suggested, will come to denote lifestyle choices more than they ever have before. Established, premium brands which continue to innovate might therefore be incredibly successful in the AV market. We must remember, then, that German OEMs serve all global markets and currently produce of 70% of all premium vehicles manufactured worldwide.
 
The existence, and continued innovation, of NPM should support this move towards driverless development. Driverless is, after all, one form of efficient, high-quality, flexible, available, safe and affordable mobility for both passenger and freight transport – the very thing NPM is hoping to achieve.

NPM project: Driverless shuttles in Hamburg
In Hamburg, progress is being made towards that exact goal. In one of the projects within RealLabHH, a real-world lab set up by NPM to gain experience with digital mobility in Germany, autonomous mobility company EasyMile, together with the partners DEKRA, DLR, VHH and Continental, are setting a new benchmark for urban mobility with an on-demand driverless shuttle service.
 
Launching in August 2021, three autonomous shuttles will provide first-last mile travel in the particularly high demand area of Bergedorf. Already well connected to a suburban rail system and other public transport, the area is ideally suited for an autonomous service which fills the gaps between homes and transport hubs.
 
This type of travel offers huge opportunities for driverless and is a key area for environmental action through transport innovation. As EasyMile write, “Bergedorf will serve as a benchmark for an environmentally and climate-friendly redesign of future mobility systems.”
 
Embarking on projects like this is no easy feat and would be impossible without the collaboration of a whole host of organizations including software developers, public transport providers and even local governments. It is NPM’s collaborative approach which makes such trials possible and, should this particular test be a success, may make the organization best placed to begin integrating driverless solutions into our daily lives.
 
Without a doubt, NPM centers Germany in the development of autonomous transport, but that is nothing if not a natural fit. At 2025AD, we can’t wait to see what comes next.
 
Share your thoughts in the comments below. What do you think of NPM? Does driverless tech fit well into their vision of a greener future for transport? We’d love to hear what you think.

While making their way to the future of mobility, visitors passed by the golden era of mobility: vintage cars like a Benz from 1915 or the historic Ford Model T. It’s all part of Autoworld, a Brussels museum that was home to AutoSens 2018, one of the world’s leading technical summits for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicle perception technology. Set in a rather impressive location, international industry and academic experts discussed what lies ahead for self-driving car technology – and what part humans will play in it.
 
This not only covers driverless vehicle passengers, but also their developers. While artificial intelligence seems to be all the rave, it still needs guidance. Henning Lategahn, CEO of 3D mapping company atlatec, explained in his speech that his company relies on “human guided AI”. The raw mapping data still needs human annotations before artificial intelligence can create the 3D map. “Especially when the lane marking quality is poor, the degree of human guidance increases,” Lategahn said.







Anantha Kancherla, Head of Self Driving Software at ride-hailing service Lyft, detailed another specific human problem: shortage of talents. According to Kancherla, Lyft heavily draws on deep learning technologies to develop their algorithms. The big challenge connected to that is finding the right mix of scientists who know the theoretical models and software engineers who can implement them. “You need both mindsets,” said Kancherla, admitting that it is not always easy to align those two backgrounds. “Alternatively, you need to find those unicorns who can do both.” However, they are a rare species, and thus, an expensive one.
 
 


BUILD YOUR OWN SELF-DRIVING CAR
Thankfully, the conference also offered the opportunity for industry leaders to meet some aspiring newcomers. They just can’t be hired yet – because they are still in high school. A group of students from Portland, Oregon, excited the audience with the self-driving car they developed entirely on their own. As part of the non-profit High School Autonomous Vehicle Project, they used an RC car, a camera sensor and an Intel processor to build and program a self-driving vehicle.







Their first major challenge was one that every company knows: organization. “We had no defined structure,” says Vikram, one of the team members. “We had to establish rules and organize ourselves.” So, they formed groups: one was in charge of the steering of the vehicle, one of the image processing and one of acceleration. They also came across two major roadblocks that sounded familiar to many of the conference visitors from the industry. “Just because we had successfully tested a scenario on our simulator, that didn’t guarantee that it also worked on the road,” remembers Vikram’s colleague Matthew. Furthermore, they soon had to find out that processing power of their car was not endless – and come up with a solution to the technological limitations.







At AutoSens, the car was already making its rounds across the carpet. But it won’t stop there for the students. “Thousands of students don’t get the opportunity we had,” they explain in a video about the project. This is why they want to develop a low-cost, customizable self-driving car kit to enable students around the world to make similar experiences.
 
 


PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE, NOT JUST USERS
One of the most insightful panel discussions of the conference also dealt with that crucial relationship of humans and machines. “How can we get customers attracted to enjoy cruising with robots?”, it asked the participants. “People are more than users. We should approach them as multi-faceted human beings,” answered Kubra Zehra Kasikci, an environmental psychologist who researches human-centric design in automated vehicles at the University of Surrey. “Humans will have a dynamic relationship with autonomous vehicles that depends on the mood, the ability and the cultural background of the person.” She urged the industry to broaden their research focus. “At the moment, they ask how we can manipulate consumers into using driverless cars. Instead, we should determine why people would actually want to use those vehicles.”








Her discussion partner Tobias Schneiderbauer, Engagement Manager at McKinsey, noted that the main reasons that prevent consumers from switching to autonomous vehicles vary with regards to the cultural background. In a recent survey, McKinsey found that a big concern among German consumers was the loss of driving for pleasure. In the USA, fear of machine malfunctions was a much bigger issue. According to Schneiderbauer, the two fatal accidents by Tesla and Uber vehicle have made U.S. consumers warier of safety aspects.
 
 


DRIVERLESS CARS: GENTRIFYING MOBILITY?
Schneiderbauer also cited increased convenience and a decrease in costs as possible incentives for consumers to switch to autonomous vehicles. When it came to the question of costs, the discussion took an interesting turn. A conference participant expressed his fear that autonomous vehicles could lead to the “gentrification of mobility” – a dystopian scenario where only wealthy individuals can afford the convenience and safety of self-driving vehicles while lower income classes will have to stick with conventional cars and transport systems. Kasikci noted that inequality of mobility was already an issue today, “depending on where you live.” In her view, the political sphere will play a central role in ensuring that the necessary infrastructure will also be available to countries that are less developed and rural areas.
 
When all was said and done, and all experts and geeks passed all those vintage cars to leave, one major finding seemed evident: despite all technological progress, the decisive factor will still be the human factor.

We spoke to automotive mobility expert Dr Wolfgang Bernhart, Senior Partner at consultancy firm Roland Berger to find out more about the issues facing traditional branding and the measures being taken to address them.

If you think of a car advert, you most likely picture an open road, a car cruising through traffic-free streets and a driver enjoying his or her time behind the wheel. But could this traditional image of driving be about to come to a screeching halt? Fast forward ten, twenty, fifty years, and these ads may no longer be relevant – as the arrival of driverless technology and alternative mobility schemes starts to challenge the core brand values of today’s auto industry.   
 
The emotional element of driving and individual mobility – such as feelings of freedom, joy, flexibility and control – have long been central to OEM branding, particularly luxury or sports lines. However, if drivers are to become passengers in automated or semi-automated vehicles, with the prime aim being to get from A to B, such emotions may no longer take front seat.

Interestingly, according to Dr Bernhart, it is not only automated driving that is putting the emotive element of driving to the test. “For many people, driving is not the same as it used to be and will not be the same in the future,” he says. “The increasing volume of vehicles on the roads is causing more traffic jams, increasing parking problems and growing frustration – particularly in cities.” Combine this with a likely increase in regulations with regard to speed, emissions and safety, and driving becomes less attractive, he adds.
 
Another key emotion connected to driving is the status associated with car ownership: in other words, the vehicle you drive says something about you. Changing opinions about driving also have the potential to change ideas about ownership. Although, as Dr Bernhart points out, the direction of the impact could vary greatly according to different social and economic factors. Whilst in Europe, the appeal of car ownership is said to be on the decline; “in developing economies, such as India or China, car ownership is still highly desirable,” he explains. Another influential factor is age: for the younger generation, alternative (smart and digital) possessions are providing new ways to express identity and status – often for a much lower price than owning a car.
 
 


A new focus for branding
“Over time, factors such as reduced stress, comfort and relaxation could become more important when talking about road transport,” suggests Dr Bernhart. If car users are no longer drivers, vehicles will need to offer a different kind of experience in order to remain an attractive transport option (compared to trains for example). A key way to do this would be to concentrate on the use of time in automated vehicles – from productive work to entertainment. “Obviously, focusing on such experiences would represent a significant shift away from current car brand DNA,” he points out.

Another key element will be service. For many consumers, the first choice they’ll make regarding driverless technology will involve new mobility schemes such as automated car sharing or shuttles. Here, consumer impressions are likely to be driven less by exterior design and more by the quality of service available – similar to an Uber ride, car rental, or even air and train travel, where opinions on reliability and communication are far more common than the machine itself.  
 
Certain studies have suggested that should car-sharing services become the principal way of getting from A to B, then certain companies could be at an advantage given their existing branding: Bentley as the luxury chauffeur brand or Volvo with their focus on safety could be seen to align more closely with the messaging surrounding automated vehicles than Lamborghini or Porsche for example. Interestingly, according to Dr Bernhart, you could also look at this another way: if daily mobility is covered by driverless mobility services, then car ownership will no longer be guided by practical concerns such as trunk size or number of seats. Instead, the one vehicle people do still invest in could be one that is simply fun to drive. In this scenario, luxury or sports brands would have the upper hand.
 
Of course, the level and scope of vehicle automation will play a key role in the way in which current brands are affected. “If all vehicles become solely linked to mobility services, then the impact on branding will be huge,” Dr Bernhart says. Automation could potentially create a new primary function for vehicles (mobility services) – and thus a new primary selling point. A useful comparison here is the smart phone. Until very recently, the core function of a telephone was to make a call; today for many people, especially the younger generation, phones are primarily a camera or a device for surfing the internet.
 


Matching customer expectations
Ultimately, target customer groups will govern the direction branding takes. This in turn will be influenced by the pace at which automated driving arrives. “People have to experience the technology for themselves to understand it,” Dr Bernhart explains. The industry therefore needs to anticipate customer expectation as the availability, acceptance and frequency of the technology evolves – not to mention the way their own products develop.
 
After all, fully or semi-automated vehicles aren’t going to appear on our roads overnight. It will be a process. While we could eventually reach a point where society no longer considers manual vehicles to be safe in comparison to automated systems – thus rendering traditional car brand values completely irrelevant – for now, a mix of privately owned cars (with varying degrees of automation) and driverless mobility services is more likely. This gradual transition to automation will also result in a gradual change in branding.

“The auto industry should adapt their brands slowly,” says Dr Bernhart. One helpful approach could be to develop sub-brands or schemes that put the focus on new possibilities, such as BMW’s European car-sharing initiative DriveNow (ReachNow in North America). Elsewhere, other companies have started repositioning themselves as “mobility” companies and have bought start-ups or formed alliances focusing on transportation as a service. Ford has acquired a private, crowdsourced shuttle service based in San Francisco known as Chariot, for example. They have also invested in the largest operator of bike-share programs (Motivate) in the US. Another approach could be to focus on certain product features, allowing a company to introduce new technology without needing to rethink their entire image.
 
As with any rebranding, the process should be subtle and managed carefully. “Sudden changes to messaging will be counterproductive and not seen as authentic,” Dr Bernhart points out. It is essential for companies to maintain trust. “Building a new image or changing an existing one takes time – but when it comes to automated driving, it is something that needs to start now.”

The Senior Consultant Automated Driving explains why BMW won’t skip level 3 – and why automation and joy of driving don’t exclude each other.
2025AD: Dr Wisselmann, you can be considered a pioneer of automated driving, having worked on driverless cars since 2004. What was your first encounter with the technology? Why did it fascinate you?
 
Dirk Wisselmann: One job of a researcher in the automobile industry is to “transform” future mobility visions into hardware so that the vision can be physically experienced as a basis for an internal evaluation. We picked up the topic of autonomous driving – in a BMW specific manner - in the year 2004 driven by a technical fascination. The result was the “BMW-TrackTrainer” – a car that was driving autonomously on the ideal line of racetracks with racing speed. We used this technology on many European racetracks within our driving training. 
 
2025AD: How has the significance of automated driving developed over the years at large car manufacturers like BMW?
Dirk Wisselmann: The increasing automation of vehicle functions is inextricably tied to the development of cars. Therefore the introduction of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), like parking distance control (PDC) or the radar based speed and distance control (ACC), in the nineties of the last century was a logic step. The enormous increase of the performance of these ADAS in the last years will now make the next step realizable – to give the driver the possibility to completely delegate the driving task to the car if he wants to do so. Fully automated driving also offers the chance to realize completely new mobility concepts with a high potential to optimize the traffic situation especially in urban areas.
 
2025AD: Surveys show that many consumers remain skeptical when it comes to driverless cars. How can OEMs tackle this issue?
Wisselmann: If you ask ""normal"" drivers, if they want to use a self-driving car, you are very often facing a high degree of skepticism, especially in Germany. The people are scared or irritated by the loss of control, the aspects of safety, the individual benefits and so on. In my experience, these negative arguments disappear once the drivers experience an autonomous car in real life. Then they are fascinated that the cars are already working very well, they develop trust in the new functionality very quickly and they acknowledge the positive aspects of comfort and safety. Therefore, I am sure that we will not have any acceptance problems with autonomous driving. The prerequisite is of course that the autonomous car is driving on a very high technical level. The reverse conclusion is also valid: a “bad” autonomous car confirms all prejudices and worsens the acceptance situation.

2025AD: Most consumers haven’t seen an autonomous vehicle on the road yet, let alone sat in one themselves. Some of your competitors like Volvo include average consumers in their testing efforts, hoping to increase acceptance. What is BMW’s stance on this?
Wisselmann: The evaluation of new functionalities by normal customers to the earliest possible date is an integral part of the standard development process of BMW. The first evaluation usually starts in the driving simulator. In the next step, BMW invites customers to test drives on test and proving grounds and on public roads at a later stage of the development. All these activities are ongoing in an intensified mode today for the development of our highly and fully autonomous cars. An even broader field operational test would have to be discussed with respect to communication aspects. 
    
2025AD: Once they use them, people tend to quickly trust automated cars, which can create risky situations if they suddenly need to take back control. Did you have similar experience with test drivers? What can be done to avoid this “complacency effect” – or should we skip Level 2 and maybe even 3 straightaway?
Wisselmann: Theoretical discussions of the human-machine-interface of so called level-2 functions, for example the lane and steering control assistant, are very often critical, because these functions take away the “workload” from the driver and they degrade him only to monitor the driving task. In reality, the circumstances are different. A broad investigation of the accident behavior of one million BMW cars equipped with level 1 and 2 functions over the period from 2014 to 2017 has shown that these cars had between 15 and 60 percent less accidents than cars without any ADAS. This enormous increase in safety shows that all theoretical secondary effects like “overtrusting” are by far overcompensated. For this reason, we see the introduction of level 3 functions as an important first step. In specific driving situations the car requests the takeover of the human driver, for instance to drive through a complex working zone. Intense studies in driving simulators have shown that the driver has enough time to execute this takeover process safely. In the medium term, these level 3 functions will be replaced by level 4. Then, the driver will be able to sleep on a long distance trip on highways because the car is able to handle safely all driving situations by itself.

2025AD: We all hear a lot about all types of routes and trips that fully automated vehicles have mastered. So far so good. But maybe it would also be very fruitful be to talk about daily situations that automated vehicles in general still have difficulties with. Can you shed some light on this?
Wisselmann: On a long term view, the biggest challenge for automated cars will be heavy weather conditions. I’am not talking about a “normal” rain shower but conditions where human drivers also operate on the limits of their perceptibility. Examples are rain storms in autumn, or heavy snow fall with snow-capped roads in the winter time. In these situations, the performance of an experienced human driver is still above the machine capabilities. The complexity of the driving situation itself is generally not a problem of automation. Here we are facing problems that are more practical. That means we need enough training and testing material for our KI-algorithms to interpret very complex driving situations correctly.      
  
2025AD: What is BMW’s overall strategy when it comes to testing autonomous vehicles? What are the different cases and scenarios that need to be covered?
Wisselmann: The testing of autonomous cars is completely different from the present testing of ADAS. For an automated emergency braking system for example you can quite easily define the potential accident situations and investigate these in the simulation or in reality with prototype cars. With extensive driving tests on public roads with experienced test drivers it is guaranteed that no faulty activations appear. The increase in road safety mentioned above shows that this procedure works well for today’s ADAS. For autonomous driving, it is clear that it is not sufficient only to look at these “specific use cases”. Here the car manufacturer has to ensure that the car behaves safely in all future driving situations. Theoretical investigations have shown that – depending on the accident type and the driving environment – between 240 million and 6.6 billion testing kilometers would have to be driven to be sure that the autonomous driving is safer than the average driver. This extent is not achievable in reality.

2025AD: Simulation seems to be seen as the magic tool to let cars learn. But where are the limits? What cases can be simulated and what cases need to be tested in real-world driving situations?
Wisselmann: The validation of autonomous cars therefore requires the usage of all today’s methods in a new combination:               

As a first step, prototype cars with safety drivers are testing the autonomous driving in normal- and specific driving situations. Here no safety critical driving situations can be investigated because this would be too dangerous for the test drivers and the other participants on the road. The testing kilometers are in the range of double-digit millions.


On the basis of this broad situation catalog of normal and specific driving situations, a stochastic simulation is performed to vary all situation parameters to reach a “100%”-coverage of all future driving situations.


Safety critical driving situations are then safely investigated on test tracks and in simulation studies. These situations are derived from the existing test catalog of  ADAS as well as from field data and from the accident statistics and accident analysis.

Overall, this mixed approach based on a mix of experiments and simulations ensures that we fulfill our enhanced safety targets in real life traffic later on.
 
2025AD: When it comes to real-world testing, where on the planet do you test the different driving scenarios or road and weather conditions?
Wisselmann: It is necessary to test autonomous cars in every market. Every country is different with respect to traffic rules, traffic signs, driving style of the human drivers, weather conditions and so on. This leads to an enormous effort – but we are used to enormous efforts from the development of ADAS.

2025AD: At first glance, BMW’s iconic claims like “Freude am Fahren” or “The Ultimate Driving Machine” seem to contradict the idea of automated driving. How does BMW resolve this?
Wisselmann: „Sheer driving pleasure” will not end until a BMW has no steering wheel. This will be the case with urban people movers. But these robotaxis in their first generation will not be able to drive over rural roads with the required speed. That means, level 4 cars with a steering wheel will exist for a long time – maybe forever? – so that the human driver is able to drive by himself, if he wants to. Therefore “sheer driving pleasure” will remain a part of a BMW – on driver’s demand!      
 
2025AD: What do you see as the next big technological step in automated driving development?
Wisselmann: In times where no highly automated car is available on the market, it is an interesting topic to think about the future development. I personally believe that the consideration of basic human properties and needs will remain an important factor for differentiation in the automobile market. A car today is a means of transportation, a sport-device, a place for cocooning, a prestige object and so on. A company who is able to implement these factors into the product development process may have a competitive edge on the market.       
 
2025AD: In the future, how will you personally spend your free time in your self-driving BMW?
Wisselmann: I’m an enthusiastic motorcyle rider and I‘am dreaming about a fully automated BMW car which is able to transport me and my oldtimer-racing BMW to a race track so I can do some fast laps - on my own.

In the third part of our interview video series, machine learning expert Michael Osborne explains why we need to prevent driverless cars from becoming black boxes.

Let’s look at the big picture! At a recent developer conference of technology company Continental in Copenhagen, 2025AD had the chance to talk to several renowned experts from various fields. We asked them what impact automated driving will have on our society, how public trust in driverless cars can be created and whether humans will still drive cars in 2050. In the first part, bestselling author Martin Ford explained why he thinks humans will continue to drive in the future. In the second part, Peter Cochrane, technology consultant and former CTO of British Telecom, explained why sensors represent the biggest challenge for driverless cars . In the third part, we interview artificial intelligence Oxford expert Michael Osborne. Stay tuned for an interview with Club of Rome Co-President Prof. Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker.

2025AD: What will be the implications of AI for our society in the year 2030?
 
Michael Osborne: So, the implications of AI on our society in the year of 2030 are really quite profound and contain both enormous opportunities alongside potentially equally huge risks. So, the opportunities involve improving productivity across a wide range of different sectors: improving health outcomes, tackling environmental challenges… The risks, however, include things like the risk to labor that automation enabled by machine learning might pose, alongside an increasing concern about the impact of AI on privacy and what the data that we share with the tech firms, for instance, means for our roles as citizens. On the positive side, AI means automating away some of the tasks that we actually find least pleasant. Put another way, the things that will remain after AI has truly established itself in our workforce, are things like creativity and social intelligence: the kind of things we find most pleasant, that we do in our spare time. In a way, AI will actually make work more pleasant.
 
 
2025AD: What impact will automated driving have on our society?
 
Michael Osborne: Autonomous driving, just as with AI, will have transformational impact across the whole range of our society – changing everything from the way cities are designed to the way that data is gathered on transport and downstream consequences for mobility services.
 
 
2025AD: What does it take to create public trust in driverless cars?
 
Michael Osborne: Creating trust in AI systems is something that is very much in the thoughts of machine learning practitioners today. One of the challenges here is ensuring that the decisions that are made by machine learning systems are interpretable to some degree. The state-of-the-art machine learning is not entirely unfairly characterized as black boxes that are fundamentally not able to give good explanations for why they make the decisions that they do. So, I think that’s the technical challenge that we as machine learning developers must assume - which is to give some of that degree of transparency to the algorithms we develop. That will go a long way to giving downstream users trust in the decisions made by these algorithms.
 
 
2025AD: What is the biggest challenge on the way towards driverless mobility?
 
Michael Osborne: I think the biggest challenges to autonomous driving are actually more regulatory than technical in some ways. Even today we have the technology to deliver autonomous driving within certain well-defined areas, where the rules exist to do so. Autonomous vehicles, for instance, are quite operational today in places like airports or in factories or warehouses. The question is: where do we want to allow these vehicles to be? That means putting appropriate safeguards in place to ensure that people don’t get in the way, that there aren’t unnecessary risks. 
 
 
2025AD: In 2050, will humans still drive cars themselves?
 
Michael Osborne: So, in 2050, assuming that autonomous vehicles truly have reached their potential,  perhaps it will be illegal for humans to drive. Obviously, humans are far from perfect drivers: we’re the major course of accidents. There might actually be a case for regulation that insists that if you do want to drive you do it only within special parks for enjoyment rather than actually for transport.
 
 
2025AD: How will you spend your time during the ride once cars are self-driving?
 
Michael Osborne: I’m afraid to say my life would not be so different from my current life, because my major mode of transportation is cycling or walking and if I do get into a vehicle, it’s normally driven by someone else. What I do then is largely check twitter! So this is exciting technology but it might not change my life so much.

Karl-Thomas Neumann is known as a passionate marathon runner. But when it comes to driverless cars, the Opel CEO also demonstrates the qualities of a sprinter. Neumann is confident that autonomous mobility is just a few years away. In our interview, he talks about Opel's cooperation with parent company General Motors, driverless ride-hailing services — and how he wants to establish Opel as a household name for self-driving mobility.
 
 
2025AD: Mr. Neumann, Opel successfully reinvented the brand a couple of years ago with the claim “U-Turn in your head (Umparken im Kopf)”. Would you say that autonomous cars also require a “mental U-turn” for consumers?
 


Karl-Thomas Neumann: Definitely! Autonomous driving is currently one of the buzz words in the car industry. I am sure that the autonomous vehicle will come – and it will come a lot faster than some people think.
 
We at Opel and GM believe autonomous vehicles will make transportation safer and more efficient. Thus it will enable the future of mobility. Fully autonomous vehicles can bring customers enormous benefits in terms of greater convenience, lower costs and improved safety for their daily mobility needs.
 
 
2025AD: Until recently it seemed like Opel did not put as much emphasis on driverless cars in their communication as other OEMs. Recently you have stressed the importance of autonomous vehicles at various occasions. Was there a change of heart?
 
Neumann: We are not all that far away from autonomous driving in everyday life. We at Opel already demonstrated the development of automated driving with an Insignia research vehicle at the Intelligent Transport Systems World Congress in Detroit in the fall of 2014.
 
Even more conservative prognoses forecast that in 15 years, the penetration of autonomous vehicles will be at 15 to 20 percent. In 2030, we could see cars that don’t even have steering wheels anymore. The fact that GM established a separate unit for autonomous vehicle development and acquired Cruise Automation, a company specialized in this field earlier this year underlines the priority this area has in our company.
 
 
2025AD: Several OEMs have named a timeframe of around five years as a target to put autonomous vehicles on the roads – while some experts think this might take a few more years. What makes you optimistic that you will succeed this quickly?
 
Neumann: The time is ripe for autonomous driving. The necessary single technologies to make the vision become reality are already there. For example look at our Opel Astra. The European “Car of the Year 2016” offers various and innovative driver assistance technologies - e.g. side blind spot alert, forward collision alert, lane keep assist with automatic steering correction etc. The rapid advancement of connected technologies is providing the foundation for automated vehicles that make driving safer and easier.
 
On a global level our work is this area is already well underway. GM is cooperating with Mobileye, a technology company that develops advanced, vision-based driver-assistance systems that are key building blocks for autonomous driving.
 
GM’s premium brand Cadillac will debut a hands-free highway driving feature called Super Cruise enabled by advanced GPS and LIDAR-based maps in 2017 on the Cadillac CT6 sedan.
 
 
2025AD: Your parent company General Motors is pushing for driverless vehicles. How does the cooperation work - is Opel also conducting independent research on the topic?
 
Neumann: At Opel and GM, we are actively developing the technologies to enable partially autonomous and, eventually, fully autonomous vehicles – cars that can drive themselves. GM has established a separate business unit for autonomous vehicle development at the beginning of this year. Since engineering is a global function, Opel is part of the development activities in this important future field.
 
Opel is building a prototype that can display the essential functions of cooperative highly automated driving on the Autobahn, i.e. automatically entering the Autobahn and merging with the traffic, driving on the Autobahn including over-taking maneuvers, and finally exiting the Autobahn automatically. Initially Opel will test and validate the prototype hardware and the highly automated driving functionality on a proving ground. Testing will continue on public roads as soon as the prototype technology has reached a sufficiently advanced stage. This is part of Opel’s involvement in “Ko-HAF – Kooperatives hochautomatisiertes Fahren”, a German project researching cooperative highly automated driving.
 
Furthermore, Opel is a partner in several current or recently completed initiatives researching accident-free and automated-driving at the national and European level, such as “AdaptIVE”, the flagship project of the European Union on automated driving, UR:BAN, a German project researching cooperative highly automated driving and many more.

2025AD: You recently said that you believe that “autonomous driving will not be established top-down, but rather bottom-up.” Can you elaborate on what you mean by that?
 
Neumann: I am convinced that mainly professional providers such as ride-hailing services will drive social acceptance of autonomous driving. In general, these innovations no longer just come from luxury cars – just look at our electric car pioneer, the Ampera-e, for example. The Opel brand has always been synonymous with democratizing technologies.
 
 
2025AD: Will Opel transform from a car manufacturer into a mobility provider? What role will the cooperation with Lyft play, the ride-hailing service that GM has invested in?
 
Neumann: To successfully shape the automotive future, carmakers will need to do more than just build impressive vehicles. The extension of the mobility service portfolio is a key pillar in Opel’s plan for the future as it will be crucial to evolve from a product manufacturer to a provider of mobility services.
 
With innovative services and concepts like OnStar or Maven and our partnership with Lyft as well as groundbreaking products like the Ampera-e, GM and Opel are at the forefront of defining the future of personal mobility. We see tremendous opportunities in these technologies, including the chance to develop dramatically cleaner, safer, smarter and more energy-efficient vehicles for customers around the world.
 
GM and Lyft are developing an integrated network of on-demand autonomous vehicles in the U.S. that leverages GM’s deep knowledge of autonomous technology and Lyft’s capabilities in providing a broad choice of ride-sharing services.
 
 
2025AD: What developmental opportunities arise from the GM acquisition of California-based start-up Cruise Automation?
 
Neumann: The acquisition of Cruise Automation adds deep software talent and rapid development capability to further strengthen GM’s autonomous vehicle technology development. It will accelerate previously announced plans for on-demand fleets of autonomous vehicles.

2025AD: Opel is winning praise for its electric Ampera-e vehicle. What will the combination of autonomous driving and e-mobility mean for car emissions?
 
Neumann: We take our responsibility for the climate seriously and see electric mobility as an important part of the future of mobility. Electric cars are part of that effort as they help us further reduce our CO2-footprint.
 
We have announced that we will bring the game-changing Ampera-e battery electric car to market next year. With its range of more than 500 kilometers (based on NEDC), the car outperforms its closest segment rival currently on the road by at least 100 kilometers and will revolutionize electro-mobility. Our Ampera-e is not eco-luxury, not a gadget and not just a second car. Opel is showing that emissions free mobility is also achievable for a much broader audience thanks to the most innovative technology.
 
We believe the convergence of connectivity, ridesharing and autonomous vehicles will shape the future of personal mobility and see the future of personal mobility as connected, seamless and autonomous. The so called Robotaxis will dominate the streets in the future – and they will of course be electric.
 
 
2025AD: Should customers always have the choice whether they want to drive manually or be chauffeured?
 
Neumann: I expect that people will be able to decide whether they want to drive themselves or be chauffeured. For the majority of daily drives – such as the way to and from work for example – I believe that most people would be glad if they did not have to drive themselves and could benefit from autonomous driving. However, this could be very different during weekend trips in the summer. Î am convinced that driving a great car in a beautiful surrounding on our own is something we will be able to enjoy also in the future.
 
 
2025AD: Mr. Neumann, once cars drive fully autonomously, how will this change your personal life?
 
Neumann: Autonomous driving already has changed my life. Two years ago, I wouldn't have thought that today I would be of the opinion that the technology will catch on so quickly. When this vision becomes reality, it will also bring many other positive changes. And I am sure that my generation will be able to benefit from these advantages.
 
There will be less congestion. What luxury! Currently, commuters in cities like Istanbul spend 125 hours per year in traffic jams on average. Traffic will become a lot more efficient and safer in an autonomous world. And areas that are currently needed for parking in our city centers can be used for something else. Just think of what we can do with all the space that will be available: Parks, sports facilities, playschools! So I am really looking forward to these developments.
 
 
2025AD: Mr. Neumann, thank you very much for your insights!

We talked to co-CEO Maxim Nohroudi about on-demand shuttles – and driverless ride-pooling of the future.

How would our cities look, if we could get from A to B in one go, in the most comfortable way? If it was up to Berlin-based tech firm door2door, we wouldn't have to even own a car to experience the ease of mobility. Providing platform technology, the startup helps cities implement on-demand ride-pooling – and fully integrate it into their existing mobility network. Two years ago, the startup launched its shared Allygator shuttle in Berlin. Here, we sat down with co-CEO and founder Maxim Nohroudi to talk about key learnings along the way, as well as balancing business between the Bavarian Forest, Singapore and Brazil.


2025AD: Mr Nohroudi, we kicked off our day by doing a commuter survey in our team. Half of us spent the morning stuck in city traffic; some missed their subway while looking for a parking spot. Buses were either packed – or half-empty. Surely, we can do better than this?
 
Maxim Nohroudi: Cities have paid little attention to public transport in the past 30 years. The goal was to make transit economically efficient – through cost-cutting. As a result, quality has suffered. However, we've seen a mind shift in the past years – both on the side of transport officials and among citizens. People want convenient mobility, and they want to get from A to B in one go. And while owning a private car isn't a top priority any more, they are willing to share their ride and pay for comfort and quality of life. An OECD study found that three shuttles can replace 100 cars. That’s where our vision kicks in: the vision of shared mobility that lets you combine different modes of transport without having to own them. We call it multimodal, on-demand mobility – and the time is ripe for it.
 
2025AD: What's your exact mission?
 
Nohroudi: Providing digital platform technology, we're enabling communities and transport services to run on-demand ride-pooling shuttles and integrate them into their transportation networks, thus making public transit as user-friendly as possible. The reason why we’re working with cities? They know their business better than anybody else. For example, the Munich transport authority has 100 years of experience in moving people around town, maintaining infrastructure and creating new routes. Why should we rival a powerful player by offering a separate set of mobility services?

2025AD: You've been operating the Allygator shuttle in Berlin since 2016 – your first on-demand service in Germany. What is the service all about? And what have you learned?
 
Nohroudi: Allygator is a perfect playground for us to test ride-pooling in an urban environment – gathering data and insights on how to make on-demand a safe bet. The best part: we don't have to launch it as a new mobility product, as our customers already have experience in public transport. Basically, we've gained three insights. First off, we've debunked the cliché that elderly people wouldn't use digital mobility services. In fact, many of our riders are more than 60 years old. Second, we've seen how much customers appreciate comfort: The shuttle combines all benefits of individual transport – space, quietness, convenience – with the opportunity to get on and off wherever you want. And third, we've seen how important services like Allygator, but also our myBUS concept in Duisburg, are in solving the first-last mile problem.
 
2025AD: What distinguishes door2door from companies like Uber and Lyft?
 
Nohroudi: We pursue a land and expand approach. That means we’re working with our partners to find tailor-made solutions for their specific areas. Uber, for example, does it the other way around. They’re rolling out a single product worldwide. But one-size-fits-all concepts don’t work in the mobility sector. Cities vary in size, infrastructure and population – and transport authorities understand these peculiarities best. Besides, Uber offers ride-hailing as an alternative to public transit; we offer ride-pooling as a part of it. Also, in Uber and Lyft’s case, it’s private drivers working for private shareholders.

2025AD: In the future, modes of transport including ride-sharing will be seamlessly connected. But where do we stand today?
 
Nohroudi: We're still at the beginning. But the integration will come fast. Cities like Duisburg, Munich, Offenbach and Freyung in the Bavarian Forest are quick to adopt our solutions. As soon as 2019, on-demand services will be available on a broader scale. From 2020 on, we'll see even more elaborate levels of integration – both in depth and breadth. The technology is ready, the products are ready – and so are our partner cities.
 
2025AD: What expansion plans do you have? Any plans to go international?
 
Nohroudi: Our 2018 goal was to have partnerships with a total of 30 cities – a goal we've reached. We run parts of the Portuguese on-demand market and we have partners in Switzerland, Austria and Italy. Plus, we've set up an office in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I just came back from a trip to Singapore, where we're in talks with the Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) authority about a project involving on-demand ride-pooling. Singapore is a sandbox environment for integrated transportation. The Lion City already reduces roads and limits private cars – fleets of centrally operated, shared shuttles will hit fertile soil. Interestingly, SMRT is in contact with the city of Munich to gain insights. It's a big world, but it's a small mobility community.
 
2025AD: Ride-sharing promises to solve congestion. However, critics argue it could cannibalize public transport by seducing people to go by car. Is a symbiosis even possible?
 
Nohroudi: It is! But there are some prerequisites to be met to create a co-existence. Ride-sharing must be centrally integrated into the existing mobility ecosystem – not be established as an alternative or as a separate silo. New York's MTA has seen a decrease in passengers due to private transport services like Uber. An integrated app, however, knows how to get you to your downtown destination in the quickest and most convenient way. That may be by subway, but certainly not by car during rush hour. Also, ride-pooling must be algorithm-driven to let people, who are going in the same direction, share a ride.

2025AD: Helsinki intends to be free of private cars by 2025. Do you see similar scenarios for German cities?
 
Nohroudi: The Nordics are always five to ten years ahead of time. Helsinki has everything it takes to be a first mover in shared on-demand mobility. By expanding their public transportation system and taking regulatory steps, owning a private car could be pointless in the future. The city’s vision even proposes public and shared transport to be paid for via a single application. It’s a lighthouse project that I hope will help convince the German public.
 
2025AD: Which role does autonomous driving play in future public transport – and in your business plans in particular?
 
Nohroudi: Driverless mobility will be a building block to make public transport more attractive and accessible. Not only do autonomous vehicles hold the potential to make roads significantly safer, but they will be able operate 24/7. On top of that, they will cut costs for mobility – both for providers and customers. As soon as regulation allows for it, we’ll start showcasing automated shuttles ourselves. But that’s just part of a larger trend: from 2023 on, we’ll see a whole generation of self-driving vehicles on our roads that will offer a mind-blowing driver experience.
 
2025AD: And finally, how will you use your free time on your way to work, once the day of autonomous, connected driving arrives?
 
Nohroudi: Reading! That would be my number one activity to relax. Although simply letting go of the steering wheel, switching off and not having to monitor traffic will be relaxing enough!

In an exclusive interview, Danny Shapiro, Senior Director of Automotive, explains how to develop safe driverless cars – and how NVIDIA is growing its ecosystem with more than 300 automotive companies.
 
There are countless predictions regarding automated driving. Who will be the first carmaker to put self-driving vehicles on our roads? How many of those cars will be sold in ten years? The answers will vary, depending on what study you read. Which just goes to show: forecasting in this field is tough. But there is one prediction many experts would instantly agree on: whoever wins the race for driverless mobility will probably rely on NVIDIA technology. The AI computing company has secured a key role in the development of autonomous driving systems, and is now moving into production. We spoke to Danny Shapiro, Senior Director of Automotive, on challenges and responsibilities that arise from this unique market position.
 

2025AD: Mr. Shapiro, what was your first encounter with automated driving?
Danny Shapiro: My first experience inside an autonomous vehicle was at CES several years ago when BMW ran an automated car on a closed race track. It wasn’t truly autonomous, but it was a computer-controlled vehicle that drove a fixed route at high-speed, with nobody touching the wheel. It was a transformative experience. Since then I’ve ridden in many autonomous vehicles. I drive an automated car to work every day, powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. It’s a Level 2 system, which means I am responsible and still have to monitor it. However, having an AI computer handling routine driving tasks means it doesn’t bother to be in a traffic jam. My commute experience is much more relaxing.
 
2025AD: NVIDIA has been very successful in designing Graphic Processing Units (GPU) for video games. But your company turned into a huge player in the autonomous driving space within just a couple of years. How did this come about?
Shapiro: Carmakers have been using NVIDIA GPU technology to design, engineer and manufacture their cars for two decades, and it was about ten years ago that we started using our processors and software inside the vehicle to improve the user experience. Initially that meant bringing consumer electronics style graphics and interactivity into infotainment systems. Then as our mobile computing horsepower dramatically increased, we introduced AI technology to accelerate the development of automated vehicles. Our relationships with numerous vehicle makers has put us in pole position for supplying compute and artificial intelligence technology – far ahead of any other supplier.

2025AD: With automated driving, NVIDIA technology could become crucial for the safety of billions of drivers. How do you deal with this enormous responsibility?
Shapiro: Safety is our number one priority. If there is a problem with the navigation system, it’s not life critical. But as we move toward fully autonomous driving, safety is paramount. NVIDIA’s solutions adhere to the strictest safety requirements. Within the industry, there is a race to develop self-driving vehicles and put them on the road, however we need to ensure the safety of the systems. To that end, at CES earlier this year we announced the world’s first functionally safe AI self-driving system, which uses redundant and diverse functions to make sure a vehicle will operate safely, even in the event of faults related to the operator, environment or systems.
 
 
2025AD: How can you ensure the safety of the systems?
There is no way we can generate enough miles to train and validate our deep neural networks only relying on real-world driving. So, NVIDIA has developed solutions for simulation. Building on our company’s video gaming heritage, we can simulate all different driving scenarios far more efficiently. Will the car detect a pedestrian at night in a rain storm? Will it see that child running in front of a vehicle from behind a parked car? In a datacenter, using our deep-learning supercomputer known as DGX, we can simulate 60,000 miles of driving in just one hour. That means we could simulate driving every single road in the US in just two days. These simulated miles are used to not only train complex deep neural networks, but can help validate the safety of autonomous driving algorithms.

2025AD: You mentioned the race among all players towards fully autonomous driving – which could also be seen at this year’s CES which was overflowing with bold announcements. Are we experiencing a hype?
Shapiro: Some people call it hype, but I do not agree with that. It really is a transformative time. There is a lot of news being reported simply because there is a great deal of activity and advancements being made. Virtually every automaker is working on some form of automated driving. Of course, not every company is going to make it. It is true that we’re working with over 320 partners that develop autonomous driving solutions on our NVIDIA DRIVE platform. This includes over 150 startups working on new sensor technology, mapping or algorithms. Some of these companies might not still be around at the end of this year. Others might be bought by bigger companies. But the truth of the matter is that we will see great advancements this year and in the next few years to come.
 
 
2025AD: With NVIDIA having more than 320 partners, to what extent is it possible for carmakers to customize products to allow for differentiation?
Shapiro: Developing an autonomous vehicle computer is very different than supplying a component. We do not sell a fixed product for a carmaker to simply stick in their car. Rather, NVIDIA has a true development relationship with carmakers. We are building programmable computer systems comprised of hardware and a massive amount of software. NVIDIA DRIVE is an open system, meaning our customers build their applications on top of our technology. That gives them the ability to customize the user experience, the features of that vehicle, and the level of automation. They will also have the ability to update the car over time – much like updates for your smartphone. For instance, Tesla built their car around NVIDIA technology. With software updates, they can change the user interface, they can change driving dynamics, and they can add new autonomous capabilities.
 
 
2025AD: Your CEO Jensen Huang announced at CES the DRIVE Xavier, the new processor with an unheard-of amount of processing power, enables fully autonomous driving. Would you consider the question of providing sufficient computing power for driverless cars solved?
Shapiro: There is never enough computing performance. The deep neural networks that we are running will continue to become more and more complex. There will be more sensors on vehicles, generating more data – so the need for computation in the car will continue to increase. The critical issue here is safety. We will need to increase the level of redundancy in systems. DRIVE Xavier delivers the highest level of compute performance today, and its energy efficiency is designed to enable production AV systems. But for a level 5 Robotaxi, we envision multiple Xavier processors plus discrete GPUs being combined to deliver the computation required. Much like humans are constantly learning, these cars will continue to get smarter and smarter over time.

2025AD: One of your biggest competitors is Intel. Having acquired Mobileye in 2017, they claim that the approach of ever increasing the amount of data is flawed and that they aim to collect only as much data as necessary – to keep data sets and costs manageable. What do you say to that?
Shapiro: Our competition has a fundamentally different approach. We believe autonomous driving is a super-computing problem. The more data you have, the higher your level of reliability. The other approach is: being a component supplier, having a very low-energy, low-compute solution like smart cameras, and trying to use that to drive an autonomous vehicle. It just won’t work. If you look at all the companies that are developing level 5 robotaxis, essentially every single one of them is using NVIDIA. They recognize the need for massive amount compute cycles versus trying to leverage an array of smart camera processors.  
 
2025AD: What are the hurdles that still lie ahead for NVIDIA on the road to fully automated cars?
Shapiro: We will continue to work on delivering vehicles that are remarkably safer than any human-driven vehicle. But as a society, we need to figure out: does an AV need to be two times safer? Ten times safer? A hundred times safer? At what point does society say: we are ready to put these vehicles on our roads? I don’t know whether it will be possible to prevent every accident out there as long as many cars are driven by humans. But we will dramatically reduce the number of accidents and fatalities.

That’s obviously not the case anymore, and technology is the reason why.”






Michael Bless, author and historian of science at Vanderbilt University, is right to highlight the huge impact of technology. In even just the past decade, the patterns of our lives have shifted dramatically, and, for many, this has marked a decreasing connection with people.
 
We’ve asked before whether tech is driving us apart, and, yes, in some ways it is. Alexa may now be the first ‘person’ we talk to in the morning, and intelligent machines have stepped into many roles where we would once have found a human, but that doesn’t mean technology isn’t bringing us closer together in other ways.
 

 
Is tech breaking or making human connection?
Technology of all kinds keeps us connected in a way that would have been unimaginable a few decades ago. Zoom, Teams, houseparty, WhatsApp, even email and text messaging means we can reach out across the globe in an instant, and we’re only becoming more connected. Just think of how the Covid-19 outbreak has pushed what were once live experiences into a virtual world.
 
We now have a near unending supply of resources, educational materials, and systems for people to learn or work from home. We can visit museums, gardens and concerts online. While the world has never felt more physically isolated, digital media offer a bridge to keep us connected. Agustín Fuentes, a professor of anthropolgy at Princeton, captures the mood perfectly, saying, “What is so important to humanity is connection. Quarantines require people to connect in other ways, we’ve adapted to survive.”
 
And autonomous tech will help even more of us adapt to, and thrive in, a post-Covid world. Working in tandem with technologies which allow us to see each other virtually, driverless vehicles offer the chance for us visit loved ones with similar ease.
 

 
Driverless vehicles: A lifeline for those in need
“There is an unfortunate paradox in which at the time of your life when you are largely free from employment or child care, and have more free time to travel, physical and cognitive ability may be declining, making travel more difficult.” 
George Holley-Moore and Helen Creighton, AgeUK
 
For parts of our communities – older people and those affected by disability in particular – travel is often a stumbling block. Yet it remains vital to forming and maintaining human connections. This is where autonomous technology could become life changing, offering a lifeline to those unable to travel independently and giving more options to those who aren’t ready to stop driving altogether.
 
In Japan, for example, an extensive, and increasingly autonomised, travel network means older generations have the freedom to visit new places, meet people, and be part of the events which bring families together. After all, travel is essential for so many celebrations. In China the world’s largest human migration occurs around a holiday which sees city populations spread into a rural regions as many travel home – a journey which would be made simpler by AD.
 
Autonomous driving then, is a technology which will enable inclusion and human connection. By making travel simpler and more accessible it will likely make it more common too. In this way, technology will inevitably bring us closer together, not drive us apart.
 

 
Four ways autonomous driving can bring us together
1 Simplifying travel for disabled drivers
 
When designed with accessibility in mind, vehicles with some degree of automation could be the ideal solution for disabled drivers. Not all autonomous vehicles are able to operate without any manual input, and this is not necessarily needed for most disabilities. Instead, autonomous level two or three, where features like rear-view cameras, lane-keeping assist and automated parking remove the need to actively turn in a seat or perform complex manoeuvres, could put many affected by disability back in the driving seat.
 
2 Giving older people freedom
 
Though we might think older people are keen to give up driving, a survey from Age UK found that just 1% of drivers over 60 would hand over their keys on the basis of age alone. But taking a health-based approach, autonomous tech could prove immensely useful for older generations. Choosing a vehicle with some degree of automation could boost confidence and extend our driving years, while fully autonomous travel gives those who no longer want to drive the option to travel just as freely.
 
3 Making connections en route
 
Ridesharing is often discussed alongside the future of driverless technology and the two go hand in hand. It has been predicted that as few as 20% of us will own a car by 2030, with the majority using services akin to Uber or Lyft instead. With driverless options like the E-Shuttle CuBE making this experience a shared, and sociable, one, even travel itself could become a place to make new connections.
 
4 Opening up rural communities
 
Often suffering from poor transport networks that make leaving the local area a task which requires immense organisation and a stroke of good luck, rural communities could be better served by autonomous vehicles. More reliable, easily accessible and available to drivers and non-drivers alike using road networks already in place, AVs would make it much simpler to travel in and out, enabling locals to catch up with friends and family beyond the community.
 
There are almost countless ways driverless tech can bring us together, but we can’t deny that it has the potential to keep us apart too. Instead of using AVs to travel more and socialise on our journeys, we might send cars on errands for ease and reduce our opportunities to make new connections as a result. Ultimately, it has the potential to both make and break connections – the question is simply how we choose to use it.

But there’s more to how a driverless mobility system will impact our lives. 
 
As an innovation consultancy interested in long-term issues, Andthen wanted to delve deeper into the potential knock-on effects of AVs, moving beyond the first-order consequences we often hear about. Instead, we wanted to anticipate some of the deeper changes we might see — the second, or third-order consequences – with a goal to write a few short stories about what a future with AVs might look like.

While riders were overjoyed with the benefits autonomous vehicle brought, the same could not be said about big retail. Small stores near transport hubs and thoroughfares were the first to disappear. Following quickly in their footsteps were those who failed to maximise delivered-to-your-door models.
‍
As riders built up a tolerance for distance, and autonomous vehicles made ‘next hour’ deliveries a reality, they started to get much more picky and intentional about where they went for their daily shopping. Stumbling into the local convenience store on the way home from work was a thing of the past, and, instead, the independent grocers in the neighbouring area were much more likely to get a visit. 
 
Where else has similar change happened?“It was easy to predict mass car ownership but hard to predict Walmart.” Carl Sagan
 
This quote speaks to the wave of unintended consequences brought about by the automotive revolution. In the same way that cars allowed for the out-of-town shopping centre, so too will autonomous vehicles reshape the retail industry of tomorrow.

2. Not all roads are created equal 
At first, there was a medley of transport services. Each had their own unique offering, but over time smaller services were picked off one by one. The remaining companies discovered a new power; not only did they have control of the roads, but they also had control of the way traffic moved. 
‍
Soon, riders saw ‘premium subscriptions’ being advertised and, little by little, riders noticed changes to their commutes — it seemed to take longer, there were lanes which always seemed empty, and at peak times it seemed like someone else always got picked up immediately while you waited. When the first luxury vehicle whooshed past in the rush hour migration, it was clear that the roads, once a cornerstone of public infrastructure, had been invaded by corporate interests.
 
Have we seen this before?
 
This future is with us in a small way today in the form of Uber’s surge charges – those who are willing to pay more during moments of transport stress can go about their days, while those who don’t must make do with a second-rate service.

3. Sprawling autonomous cities 
With the stress of city living and an increasing allure of being closer to nature, inner-city residents did what they thought was right and fled. With transport being cheaper and easier than ever thanks to AVs, the commute was suddenly useful, not wasted, time. 
 
Major homebuilders followed suit. Sprawling new housing estates sprung up in which everyone could get their square of walled garden – distance didn’t matter because AVs made it so easy to make any trip. Even when people noticed that journeys that used to be walked or cycled were increasingly being made by AVs, nobody could stand in the face of achieving ‘the lifestyle.’ 
 
How is urban density linked to movement?
 
Already we can pinpoint cities designed with specific technology in mind. Head to Atlanta or Los Angeles without a car and getting around is almost impossible thanks to urban sprawl.

4. On the move, yet sedentary 
Initiatives focused directly on transportation might consider investing in public autonomous transport systems, more social forms of travel or even multimodal transportation that enables a combination of walking, cycling, private and public AVs to combat increasingly sedentary lifestyles. 
 
Effective transport systems need mobility solutions and urban planning to support one another. Good urban planning should emphasise walkability and social interactions to avoid the building of sprawling autonomous cities. 
 
How will AVs affect our social and physical habits?
 
With travel so easy via AVs, it’s likely that getting our 10,000 steps per day will look much more challenging in the future. Just as the dawn of the digital age has completely changed how we interact with each other, driverless cars will completely change how we understand movement and socialising.

5. New urban spaces
It took only 15 years for cars to replace horses as the main means of transportation. In that transition, many jobs were displaced, and much infrastructure which had previously catered to the horse and cart was rendered useless. Now, these spaces have been transformed — carriage houses have been converted into desirable mews houses, breweries, hotels, and more.
 
As a result of the decline of the manufacturing industry, huge amounts of land, hosting now decommissioned factories, were turned to brownfield sites. Positive outcomes of this result in places like Canvey Wick in Essex in the UK, a former oil refinery that has been rewilded. Described as a “brownfield rainforest” by Natural England officer Dr Chris Gibson, it is now designated a Site of Scientific Interest (SSI) due to its abundance of wildlife. Is this the future for unused urban space? 
 
How will AVs change urban spaces?
 
What use are road signs or inner-city car parks to AVs always on the move? Might they be cleared to make space for community projects, or are these spaces more likely to be sold on for development?
 
 
How do you think AVs will change the spaces we live in and drive through? Would you pay for access to the ‘fast lane’? Would you opt for a driverless journey over walking or cycling, even over a short distance? Let us know what you think of each of these scenarios in the comment section below.

Testing is a topic which often comes up in any discussion of driverless tech. And yes, rigorous testing on various routes, in varied weather conditions and with all sorts of scenarios thrown in is vital to the development of reliable autonomous vehicles (AVs). But when it comes to testing what the general public think of self-driving cars, a decidedly low-tech experiment known as ghost riding is proving incredibly revealing.
 

You want to know more about how this data could improve autonomous cars and their ability to do a better job at driving in the darkness than humans? Read our article ""Prince of Darkness: Autonomous vehicles at night"".

 
What is ghost riding?
Cars without drivers are an unusual sight and even autonomous vehicles travelling around places like San Francisco and Palo Alto usually have an engineer behind the wheel. Precisely because of that, it’s incredibly difficult to measure how people react to cars with no drivers during regular AV testing.
 
Ghost riding provides a simple solution. Most of us will recognise it as a prank that’s been entertaining viewers for at least the past decade. To perform the trick, a driver conceals themselves within a car seat to create the illusion of a self-driving vehicle with no passengers, and no one at the steering wheel.




Play






Ghost riding has now been the subject of much conversation, advertising campaigns and, more importantly, several serious studies into public attitudes towards driverless tech.
 
 
What do ghost riding experiments tell us?
One of the very first tests of this kind was run by Stanford University back in 2017 and it revealed some interesting truths. Sticker and mounted cameras (actually used to record reactions) gave the test car the look of a true AV, so, even before they peered through the windscreen, pedestrians had all the visual cues to expect no driver.
 
This goes some way to explaining the results: the way people walked around the car stayed relatively normal; most exhibited curiosity, not fear; and of the 67 people crossing near the car, only two tried to avoid coming close. Most were pleased with its performance and 95% of those asked said the car did what they expected it to.
 
More recent studies, led by a team from Cornell and conducted in several countries over more than five years, show that though most are accepting of AVs, there is important variation. Generally, people still moved relatively normally around the car, but they took longer to cross the street in front of it, particularly when in groups. Some of this is down to pure curiosity, but outside of the city there was more to suggest this may have been caused by fear of the unknown.
 
Testing in Mexico was particularly revealing. While in Mexico City passers-by were unphased, those in Colima, a smaller coastal town, often stopped in front of the car. Ultimately these tests have shown that most are curious about, not fearful of, the new technology. However, the varied reactions prompted by ghost riders suggests that the uptake of driverless vehicles will differ along cultural lines, with larger cities being the first ‘testing grounds’ for the tech.

Why is it important to test public acceptance of AVs?
It’s true that AVs could be developed without this extra level of low-tech testing, but it’s only through measuring how ordinary people interact with seemingly driverless cars that we can learn if autonomous driving will be viable or not. If the public don’t accept driverless cars, then they stand no chance of replacing existing forms of transport.
 
A 2017 study conducted by Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI), in collaboration with Ford, made some interesting discoveries when they placed a ghost rider in an unmarked Ford Transit Connect van on the streets of Virginia. After collecting over 150 hours of data, the team found, as in other studies, that most were simply curious about the vehicle. But they saw another problem too – the second aspect of user interface, which covers all interaction outside the car, was virtually non-existent. With no driver present to nod or wave, pedestrians struggled to work out what the car was likely to do next.
“Understanding how self-driving vehicles impact the world as we know it today is critical to ensuring we’re creating the right experience for tomorrow,” said John Shutko, Ford’s human factors technical specialist. “We need to solve the challenges presented by not having a human driver, so designing a way to replace the head nod or hand wave is fundamental to ensuring safe and efficient operation of self-driving vehicles in our communities.” It’s this idea which inspired Semcon’s slightly unsettling smiling car and which will become more and more important when designing the external user interfaces for AVs.
 
 
Are we ready to welcome driverless vehicles onto our roads? 
The results of these ghost rider tests seem to suggest so. Other research, largely conducted through surveying the public, shows that variation still exists between different social groups. For example, men, those with a higher driving mileage and those who think themselves tech-savvy are all more accepting of AVs. Findings from Capgemini Research Institute's 2019 study suggest we’re increasingly ready to ride in a driverless vehicle – 30% would do so now, but that’s expected to rise to 63% in the next decade. Ghost riding, however, has shown that even those who may not be ready to ride in an autonomous vehicle are still curious about the concept. This is great news for the future of AVs – whenever they’re ready, we will be too.
 
What do you think of the ghost rider trick? Is this the best way to test our natural reactions to driverless tech? What would you think if you saw a driverless car on the road today? We’re eager to hear your thoughts, so share them in the comments section below!

Japanese design firm, Nendo, have reimagined AVs as not just a means of travel, but a means of play. Their collection of six mobile, autonomous machines together create a single traveling playground which incorporates all the basic motions – climb, spin, swing, slide, rest and jump – which we can observe in most static play areas around the world.
 
The key difference here is, the entire playground can be moved from location to location or even summoned via an app. Plus, the monochrome machines are incredibly interactive. Not only do they travel autonomously and include functionality for play, they have distinct characters and blinking LED ‘eyes’. Perhaps this shows how, as driverless become more common, AVs might become real ‘characters’ in our lives from an early age.

Safety first. 
 
Taking inspiration from new needs arising during the recent Covid-19 pandemic, NemBot, a quarantined cabin on autonomous wheels, was designed as pandemic-proof transport. Though its creators designed the single person-sized AV for non-emergency medical transportation, they’re sure there are applications beyond the recent pandemic. Due to its small size, the AV is able to navigate tight space and meets important medical safety standards. Such transport, which can create a travelling, disinfected environment, may be central to how the future of medicine, and medical treatment, evolves from here.
 
 
 
More than road travel. 
 
Not all AVs, as we know from our dive into the world of autonomous shipping, are limited to the road. One fascinating example, planned to launch in Amsterdam, operates from the water, acting as both a bridge and ferry. Developed at MIT, the ‘RoundAround’ project aims to bring cities into closer contact with natural features like rivers using AVs in place of static bridges. The proposed robot boat bridges push the boundaries of technology and design and are endlessly adaptable. In this way, users become more in control of routes through their cities, while the self-driving boats ensure travel is just as, if not more, convenient than it has ever been.

Service to go.
 
Though personal travel might be our first concern when it comes to self-driving tech, the fact that public transport, logistics and even the military are finding ways to apply the tech suggests that, whatever we use traditional vehicles for right now, in the future AVs may replace them. Italian architect, Carlo Ratti’s design for a ‘robot’ bar making cocktails to order perfectly highlights this trend.
 
We’re all used to pop-up bars serving from the side of a van, but this one is special. Two mechanical arms shake, stir and serve your drink, while the self-driving platform takes the setup from location to location. Echoing our ‘on-demand’ culture, the concept plays on our desire for convenience above all else. After all, if the bar could come to you that easily, wouldn’t you use it?
 
 
 
Endless options.
 
It’s difficult to imagine the full extent of how AVs might change our lives, but over at Space10, they’ve had a good go, designing a whole host of adaptable vehicles for everything from virtual reality gaming to a farm on wheels. The concepts paint a picture of a world where AVs are fully integrated into our lives.
 
Particularly inventive are the farm on wheels which aims to tackle the modern problem of ‘fresh food deserts’. It would do this by bringing fresh, even still in the ground, produce to different areas. The hotel on wheels also solves a modern problem, using clean energy to reduce emissions and providing a comfortable ‘hotel’ space to offer real rest while travelling. The limits of what AVs can be adapted to do, it seems, are endless.
 
We might first aim for self-driving road vehicles, and we know these are still a way off, but applying a little imagination reveals just how significant the development of driverless will be. Not just for tech enthusiasts, but for everyone. Our world will adapt to the tech and by thinking more widely about how it might be applied, we open up new opportunities for work, play and more. Surely that makes the world of driverless more universally appealing.

We’re already travelling by road more than we used to, and that seems to peak over Christmas. In the US, 100 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more during the festive season, and nearly 90% of that is in vehicles which travel by road. And that’s before we add in all the time spent driving to and from shops, as well as in circles looking for a parking space.
 
As we come towards the end of this strange year, the challenges of travel over the festive period become even more apparent. While Covid-19 is still a threat, many of us are reluctant to use public transport and may not be too keen on car-sharing either. Plus, the peak in travel over the holidays – prompted in many places by relaxing restrictions for the days around Christmas – is already making it difficult for many to find their way home safely. Trains are fully booked, and heavy traffic seems a fact of the season.
 
For those who cannot drive, those who struggle to travel and those who are necessarily hyper-vigilant of their exposure to strangers at the moment, travel in any substantial way may seem nearly impossible. So, how could driverless technology help in the future?
 
Could AVs ease terrible traffic over Christmas?
 
It’s perhaps not the most pressing concern, but traffic certainly gets us talking over the holidays. It’s a perennial problem as the addition of extra cars – filled with all those people travelling extra miles for Christmas – leads to increased traffic, longer waits and slower journeys at a time when we just want to get to our destination.
 
Though Christmas day itself is incredibly quiet, in terms of traffic at least, we usually see a significant uptick  throughout December, rising again as we reach the New Year. Will driverless cars be the solution?
 
Quite possibly. As AVs are able to closely monitor the movements of other cars and calculate conditions more accurately than human drivers, they are able to drive closer together and many are being developed with ‘flocking’ behaviours in mind. Research has shown that a fleet of AVs working together can improve traffic flow by at least 35%, so the days of stop-start Christmas trips may soon be a thing of the past!

Could autonomous technology make travelling at Christmas safer?
 
Though we’d all love to see less traffic, a more pressing issue at Christmas – and throughout the year – is, of course, safety. Partly because so many of us see the distances we cover increase over the festive season, December has become the most dangerous time of year to travel by road. Increased volume of traffic on the roads, combined with worsening weather conditions and all the distractions Christmas might bring, means we become less effective drivers over the holidays.
 
Autonomous vehicles, on the other hand, are. With their widespread adoption seasonal dangers, like drinking and driving over Christmas and the New Year, could be eliminated as those sitting in the driving seat wouldn’t actually be in charge of the vehicle.
 
In light of the recent pandemic too, there is even more possibility of AVs keeping us safe at Christmas. Though it’s clear that public transport is a more environmentally friendly option, it’s easy to see why many are reluctant to travel in close quarters with strangers right now. Driverless cars on the other hand offer travel which would allow even the most vulnerable among us to come closer together while keeping our distance in the current situation, or any similar outbreak in the future.
 

You want to know more about how the recent Covid19 has affected the journey of autonomous technology on our roads? Read our article ""COVID19: smart mobility goes viral.""

 
 
But before we realise these benefits, we would have to become comfortable trusting AVs with even our most vulnerable – something which our recent interview with two American mums showed may still be a way off – and AVs must become capable of safely navigating the bad weather we often see in December. These may take time to develop, but once realised, we’ll surely be rewarded.

Will driverless tech ultimately deliver universal mobility?
 
Non-drivers will see those rewards too. We’ve spoken before about how transport systems which rely on an individual’s ability to either drive, walk or access public transport leave a ‘mobility underclass’ which simply cannot access straightforward, accessible and affordable travel. Across Europe young people are particularly at-risk drivers, those with disabilities have long known the flaws in public transportation and many older people are feeling obligated to drive, though they’re more likely to lose control of their cars if distracted, because there are few other options open to them.
 
For each of these groups, especially around the holidays when so many of us want to spend time together, driverless vehicles offer fresh opportunities. Travel becomes more accessible once an AV can collect you from your home, the knowledge requirements for travelling in one are minimal and the time spent en route can be used productively too. It has been suggested that the universal mobility driverless tech could offer has the potential to change people’s lives dramatically – making work, social opportunities and more all more accessible – and offers a much better chance of arriving at a destination safe and sound. What a wonderful thing that would be over the festive season.
 
Would you use an AV to travel home for Christmas? Are you excited that AVs could mean reduced traffic? Or is giving people who are less able to travel new ways to do just that a particular pull? We’re always interested to hear your thoughts – share them in the comments below.

We are only human after all. But how accepting will we be, when machines take over driving - and fail? Would one fatal error cause a mass movement against driverless cars? We spoke to an expert to get the answers.

How do innovations reach public acceptance? Professor Armin Grunwald knows a thing or two about that. The technology assessor advises the German parliament on the impact that new technologies have on society. “Sometimes my job is to think about technologies that don’t even exist yet,” he tells us. Automated driving and driverless cars are key topics for him: fully automated cars already exist – but it will take years until they will be on our roads in large numbers.  We asked him how technology failures could change the public perception – and what carmakers need to do to prevent this.
 
2025AD: How do you approach assessing the risks of automated and driverless cars?
 
Armin Grunwald: The first question I ask myself with any technology: what is really new about it – and how is it embedded in a historical development? If you look at the anti-lock braking system or park assistants, you will find that the past decades have already seen a trend towards vehicle automation. But fully autonomous driving will mean a new level: you entrust the car with full responsibility for your safety. This raises a lot of questions. We should, however, not jump to conclusions prematurely. What some people consider a risk, others will see as a chance.
 
2025AD: What is necessary for a new technology to gain public acceptance?
 

Grunwald: A technology will achieve a high level of acceptance if the end user clearly recognizes its advantages. Take the smartphone: even people who worry about mobile phone radiation have one. The benefits are so convincing that the end user is prepared to accept a certain risk. I think we can compare this to the automated car. It will likely make driving a lot safer and more comfortable. We will have to address possible risks. But I do not expect them to be crucial for public acceptance.
 
2025AD: Human drivers are responsible for thousands of road deaths each year – strangely without much of a public outcry. But what happens if automated technology fails? Will people accept casualties caused by machines?
 
Grunwald: To a certain degree, our society can cope with technology failures. That means if the amount of damage, the number of people affected and the number of fatalities do not exceed a certain level. “Normal” work accidents, even mining disasters, caused by technical errors, prove this. What leads to acceptance problems are major catastrophes – like Chernobyl or Fukushima. I do not think such a worst case is realistic for autonomous driving.



2025AD: But the media is extensively covering minor incidents that happen during autonomous test rides – questioning the safety of the self-driving cars. Assuming a driverless car causes a fatal accident: can mass media sensationalism destroy the technology’s reputation?
 
Grunwald: I have no doubt: at some point, this complex technology in some specific situation will have a malfunction and cause an accident. And people will be harmed by it. This will spur debates. Then we will need to look at the overall statistic: currently, humans are responsible for more than 90 percent of all accidents. If autonomous driving can reduce a large proportion of those road deaths, the public will accept it. Even if the systems fail occasionally, it is not likely that people will reject the technology as a whole.
 


2025AD: Will the car manufacturer become the target of public rage?
 
Grunwald: In the 1980s, rumors spread in the United States about Audi vehicles with automatic transmissions that accelerated unintendedly. Audi reacted too hesitantly and the mass media covered the incidents extensively. For years to come, Audi suffered from massive slumps in sales. This can happen to single manufacturers and cause serious damage to them. Media sensationalism is part of the world that we live in. But on the other hand, public scrutiny is the prerequisite of a democratic society. It motivates companies to develop safe products.
 
2025AD: The car industry is getting closer to autonomous driving step-by-step, gradually implementing more Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. Is this the right approach?
 
Grunwald: Yes. It is important that there is no hasty introduction. I know there is a lot of competitive pressure. Every manufacturer wants to be the first with an autonomous vehicle on the market. But immature technology can lead to severe acceptance problems. Customers would simply stop buying autonomous vehicles. The market would regulate itself. Accidents on a massive scale could also provoke politics to react and ban the technology – comparable to the German government abandoning nuclear power after the Fukushima catastrophe. But to be clear: my impression is that car manufacturers are acting very responsibly.
 
2025AD: How should the industry communicate on the topic?
 
Grunwald: First of all, it should focus on explaining the benefits of the technology to the end user. Arguments like ‘This will create a lot of jobs’ are not enough to convince the public. Secondly, transparency is key. The industry should openly communicate problems. In our mediatized society, the worst strategy is to try to cover things up. That increases the damage. It makes more sense to admit frankly that complex systems have their pitfalls. And thirdly: enter into a dialogue with the customers, listen to them and build trust! Carmakers should not belittle the customers’ concerns. Oftentimes such a dialogue serves as an inspiration for improving the own product.
 
2025AD: What’s your projection: if we look 10 to 15 years ahead, will automated driving be accepted by our society?
 
Grunwald: I am not a prophet, but I assume that by 2030, autonomous vehicles will be a common sight on our roads. The automation of our traffic system will by no means be completed. But I can imagine that we will be used to the technology by then. Our society will have embraced automated driving.

Whilst in some places they still seem like a futuristic vision, elsewhere the idea (and the vehicles) are already in motion. So which cities are getting ahead?
The vehicles alone are not enough. The software alone is not enough. The legislation alone is not enough. For automated driving to become mainstream, the systems need to be tested, understood, accepted and ultimately, used. The best way to do this? Put the wheels on the road! Let’s go on an international road trip to discover which cities are embracing driverless technology.
 
BEVERLY HILLS: A MUNICIPAL AUTONOMOUS SHUTTLE SYSTEM BY 2023

Beverly Hills always has an eye on the latest happenings! And driverless tech is no exception. In April 2016, the City Council approved the mayor’s plan to develop a municipal autonomous shuttle system - the first of its kind in the United States. The idea is to provide shuttles for around 8 to 12 passengers that can be hailed by smartphone. Scheduled to coincide with the opening of the Beverly Hills subway station in 2023, it is hoped the system could tackle the so-called first/last mile problem. Whether or not resident celebrities might use them too remains to be seen!
 
TOKYO: DRIVERLESS VEHICLES FOR THE 2020 OLYMPICS

Hosting the Olympics is no walk in the park. Especially if you throw in additional extras. But that’s exactly what Japan has decided to do. Ahead of the 2020 summer games, political and business leaders from the tech-savvy country have promised to have self-driving vehicles moving people around during the event. Toyota, Nissan and Honda are all said to be working on different ideas, whilst local company Robot Taxi - a joint venture between a robotics firm and a mobile internet pioneer – has announced plans to develop thousands of driverless vehicles. Ambitious as the country’s plans might seem, we shouldn’t forget that last time the Olympics came to town in 1964, the bullet train was born.
 
GOTHENBURG: AUTONOMOUS SUVS TO BE TESTED BY CUSTOMERS IN 2017

Swedes in the lead. In May 2014, a joint initiative between Volvo and local agencies was announced. Backed by the national government, the initiative is described by the company as “the first real world trial of autonomous cars.” Known as Drive Me, the scheme will see SUVs be tested by actual customers on actual roads. There is of course another factor that puts countries such as Sweden on driverless car producers’ radar: snow! In contrast to the hot bed of innovation in California, Scandinavia enables tests to be carried out in harsh weather conditions – essential if the technology is to prevail as days get shorter.
 
LONDON: PROJECT LAUNCHED TO INVESTIGATE PERCEPTIONS

It seems fitting that in the UK, it is Greenwich that is keeping up with the times. The London district is home to the 8-million-pound GATEway project; launched to investigate the use, perception and acceptance of autonomous vehicles in the UK. One of the specified goals of the project is to “accelerate the take-up of driverless car technology in the UK and beyond.” Earlier this year, as part of the project, Londoners were invited to register to participate in the first UK trials of fully electric, automated, pod-like vehicles. Those taking a test ride will be interviewed before and after. Perhaps a “pod”cast would be appropriate here?
 
SINGAPORE: DRIVERLESS CABS SINCE SEPTEMBER 2016

In early September 2016, Singapore became the first place to launch driverless taxis. With several companies across the world working on the idea, it was nuTonomy – a small MIT spin-out – that took first place in the race as they deployed six driverless cabs in a business park. The plan is to have a fully operating fleet in operation by 2018. One of those pushing the driverless vision forward is Permanent Secretary for Transport Mr. Pang Kin Keong, who hopes to introduce on-demand, point-to-point pods to bring people from their doorstep to other modes of public transport. His aim is to tackle issues created by limited manpower and limited land.

With Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center based in the city, Pittsburgh has become a key playerwhen it comes to driverless technology in the United States. According to the company, the city provides “an ideal environment to develop and test our technology across a wide variety of road types, traffic patterns and weather conditions.” In September 2016, shortly after the above-mentioned Singapore launch, a select group of Uber users were able to choose the option “self-driving car” when ordering their pick-up. The 14 vehicles available on the app are being tested in real-life situations so as to help refine the technology. Would you give them a go?

Amsterdam-Schiphol airport is one of the biggest and busiest in the world. Luckily getting there and back could become highly streamlined in the future. A semi-automated bus equipped with Mercedes' most recent autonomous driving platform CityPilot has been spotted on a 12-mile (19 kilometer) stretch between the airport and the town of Haarlem. Although currently in a test phase, it seems the company has big plans for the bus. They have referred to it as the “public transport of the future.” And the name? The Future Bus!

On that subject, the wheels on the bus are also going round and round on the other side of the world. Perth was the first Australian city to trial an entirely driverless bus. Known as the RAC Intellibus, it has a top speed of 15.5 mph. Rather than replacing conventional bus routes, it has been introduced to cover the final part of a journey. At present the bus operates with a steward and has various “emergency stop” buttons on board.

The World Economic Forum recently selected Boston as a focus city for the future of mobility. Resulting in a year-long project, the city will initiate on-street testing of autonomous vehicles. The aim is to help create policy recommendations and prepare the city for a driverless future. At present, it is not clear which companies or how many vehicles will be involved in the scheme, however with testing due to start at the end of this year – all should soon be revealed.
BEIJING: FULLY AUTONOMOUS CARS FOR COMMERCIAL USE BY 2019

Chinese web services company Baidu reportedly plans to have fully autonomous cars in commercial applications by 2019. This would be followed by mass production and widespread distribution by 2021. Research has suggested that a Chinese audience could be more accepting of driverless technology than others, putting the country in a strong position to adopt the technology. With the capital repeatedly making headlines due to congestion and pollution – could driverless cars offer a road to recovery?

To make automation truly safe, they must remove some serious roadblocks: ensure road safety, guarantee data protection and resolve tricky ethical issues.

Safety must be paramount. That goes without saying if autonomous vehicles are to become a common fixture on our roads. One spectacular accident can shatter public confidence in any new technology. Look at Zeppelin airships - the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 quickly deflated their claim to be the future of air travel.
 
However, concerns about safety must not stifle progress altogether. Cars are made to be driven. Risk is therefore inevitable. The question is: how can we minimize it to a level that is acceptable to all?





      The Hindenburg: one fatal accident can be the end of an innovation.
    



A LONG WAY TO VISION ZERO
Certainly the bar will have to be set far higher for self-driving cars than conventional vehicles. Current statistics show that more than a million people are killed in traffic accidents around the world each year. Autonomous cars will be expected to do much better than that.
Trains and auto-piloted planes perhaps offer a realistic safety standard to aspire to in a first step. Airline and train crashes may garner headlines worldwide, but the fact is they are very rare – primarily because these modes of transport offer less room for human error than cars.
 
Where things get tricky, however, is that autonomous vehicles will operate in a much more complex environment than both trains and planes. Relying primarily on sensors and highly accurate map data to get around, they will nevertheless routinely face all kinds of unexpected and unpredictable hazards: erratic driving by other motorists; speeding ambulances; temporary traffic signals; heavy snow. Unexpected obstacles on the road – animals, trash, a child’s soccer ball – present perhaps the biggest challenge.
 
It is a challenge that becomes more and more complex with increasing speed. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) like Traffic Jam Assists can already handle stop-and-go paces quite well. In a couple of years, they will have to be able to deal with highway speeds.
 
How do engineers react to all these challenges? By creating innovative solutions. By developing high-tech cameras that can recognize moving objects more accurately. By establishing communication between vehicles so that cars further up ahead can warn those behind of upcoming dangers. And by perfecting emergency maneuvers that automated cars will perform in unexpected situations.
 
However, just one perfect solution for every safety issue won’t be good enough. Even the best components might fail. Which is why autonomous cars will need redundant technologies: if one feature fails, another is ready to step in. Better to be safe than sorry.
 
 


STRENGTHENING DATA PROTECTION
Safety concerns of another kind arise from the vast amounts of data that driverless cars will generate as they send and receive the information needed to transport and entertain their passengers. Where there is data, there is the potential for its abuse and this must be resolved before AD could be deemed “safe”.





      No chance for big brother: cars must be safe from spying. (Photo: Fotolia)
    


Obviously there is the immense technical challenge of making automated cars safe from cyber attacks. But we don’t even have to conjure up a criminal scenario to recognize the challenges at hand. We just need to realize that much of the data will be personal. And personal data is of course like gold dust to insurers, advertisers, investigating authorities and others who stand to gain from a better understanding of people’s behavior.
 
A supermarket might be keen to analyze customer traffic, for example. More worryingly, a government with a questionable human rights record might be interested to learn about a political opponent’s movements and contacts.
Data protection is therefore vital. Yet all sorts of questions about where it can be stored, who can have access to it, and for how long it can be held still need to be resolved.




      Data protection is key. (Photo: Fotolia)
    



In 2014, the German auto industry compiled a set of protection principles. These include transparency, the right to control what happens with one’s data, and data security. It’s a good start.
Next, data protection laws, which do not currently cover driverless car technology, must be strengthened. Potential users need to know they will be protected. Also, manufacturers need clarity to avoid confusion, potential fines or even product recalls further down the road. 
 
 


ETHICS: BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
Picture the terrible scene. You’re driving along a busy road in your autonomous car, hands off the wheel, when a small child darts out in front of you. This presents a rare but possible scenario (even though autonomous driving for city traffic is not expected before 2035). If AD is to be safe, decisions put in the hands of the car must be ethical. Should it be “programmed” to prioritize your safety or someone else’s safety? You are traveling too fast to stop. A terrible accident is unavoidable. Your car must make a split-second decision and it has three choices. What does it do?
 
1) Hit the child2) Swerve right onto the sidewalk and strike an elderly couple3) Swerve left into the path of an oncoming truck, putting yourself in harm’s way
 
The driver of a conventional vehicle might be forgiven for whichever unpalatable choice he makes in the panic of the moment. But things will be different for your self-driving car. Its life-and-death decision may not in fact be made at the scene but might have been made by computer programmers several months or years earlier. That throws up all sorts of ethical problems. Assuming your driverless car is programmed first and foremost to protect its occupant, perhaps the lesser of the two remaining evils would be to strike the couple and save the child. But would the elderly pair’s family agree? And if not, would they sue?
 
They may argue that your vehicle should have been programmed to swerve into the truck instead, putting your own life at risk, but what if your young family was in the car with you? Also, if driverless cars were to be routinely programmed to sacrifice their users to save others, how would people feel about buying them?
 
The list of questions goes on: traffic regulations might prevent the car to drive onto the sidewalk at all times. But should they do so, even in situations where a sidewalk maneuver might save lives?
 
Scenarios like the one described here are of course improbable. Also, engineers often argue that future vehicles will anticipate such situations and prevent the vehicle from getting into a moral dilemma in the first place. The car could be programmed to slow down preventively on poorly observable roads. It’s also conceivable that by 2035, children will wear transmitters that send a timely warning to approaching vehicles.
 
However, it is important that these complex ethical questions are explored and debated now - and that they are done so in the spirit of transparency and honesty.
Customers and investors need to know what to expect. Automakers must explain their reasoning behind algorithms that could take or save lives.
 
If you look at the dilemma presented here: which decision do you think the car should take and why? Take part and discuss in the comments!

In an exclusive interview with 2025AD, Audi’s Executive Vice President Electronic Development lays down his vision for a driverless future. He predicts that traditional carmakers will soon embrace entirely new business models – and reveals his idea for a premium car flat rate.

2009: An Audi TT drives autonomously across the Salt Lake in Utah. 2013: Audi is the first automotive manufacturer to receive a testing license for driverless cars in Nevada. 2015: An autonomous A7 – famously named “Jack” – drives from Palo Alto to CES in Las Vegas.
 
It’s easy for Ricky Hudi to remember the dates and details of all those driverless milestones. Because he played a key role in every single one of them. In the highly competitive race towards autonomous driving, German OEM Audi remains at the forefront – with Hudi as Executive Vice President Electronic Development being a central actor. We sat down with him to talk about his fascination for self-driving cars, Audi’s roadmap for fully autonomous driving and Audi’s cooperation with the world’s leading semiconductor producers.
 


2025AD: Mr. Hudi, you are regarded as a pioneer of automated driving. How did your fascination for the technology come about?
Ricky Hudi: This goes a long way back. In 1990, I started my professional career at BMW in Munich and I commuted there from my hometown of Ingolstadt –every day, for seven years. So I spent a lot of time on the highway. That’s when I developed a strong determination to do everything I can to ensure that one day cars can drive themselves!
 
2025AD: Was it tough to convince colleagues of the driverless vision in the beginning?
Hudi: (laughs) Not everyone was entirely convinced of the idea at first. But if you look at the degree of change that goes along with the idea, this is absolutely understandable. This is why Audi has always aimed to clearly communicate the opportunities and challenges of this revolution.
 
2025AD: How did Audi convince internal skeptics?
Hudi: Our guideline is: If you don’t want to drive yourself, your car will chauffeur you. And if you want to enjoy sporty driving, you drive yourself. This is especially important for a sporty premium brand. All those hours stuck in traffic – you can make better use of your time! With autonomous driving, we want to give our customers a 25th hour of the day – by saving them time that they would waste otherwise.
 
2025AD: When will a fully automated Audi drive on our roads?
Hudi: We will gradually introduce more driver assistance features into our cars until we reach full automation. This way, we can learn from every step and improve safety.
 
2025AD: What will your next steps be?
If you look at the current A4 or Q7, they already represent Level 2 automation which offers a high level of comfort for the driver. Next year, the new A8 will be the world’s first car with true Level 3 automation. On congested motorways, it will be able to drive itself at up to 40 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour).  When the driver needs to take over the steering wheel, there will be a proper handover. The driver always has to be in the loop – similar to a pilot in an airplane. That’s why we call it piloted driving.

2025AD: What about fully automated systems – Level 4 and higher?
Hudi: We are developing those systems in parallel. I predict that we will have them on the road at the start of the next decade. The difference between Level 4 and 5 is not as huge as one might think. Level 4 is pretty challenging because it requires considerable improvements of sensors and processing power. For the customer, Level 4 will mean a great leap in comfort because the car will be able to drive itself in many situations – not only on the highway.
 
2025AD: You have mentioned how important it is to keep the driver in the loop. How is Audi planning to ensure this?
Hudi: We have installed a camera into the instrument cluster that observes the driver. If he reads the paper or takes a nap, the system will immediately ask him to take over again. We also have hands-on detection in the steering wheel to facilitate the transition from automated to human driving. When our “Jack” prototype drove to Nevada, the unanimous feedback of the test-driving journalists was: The transition scenario was so natural that no one ever felt uncomfortable.
 
2025AD: In a recent interview you argued that the customer should be the center of the car while the vehicle itself should be treated more like a smartphone app. What do you mean by that?
Hudi: I wanted to provoke the industry a little bit. Over the last few decades we have perfected the car experience. Driving in all its facets is fun. But the customer today has a digital lifestyle. Yes, we do have smartphone integration, voice command, navigation and much more in our vehicles. But there is still work to do. Car experience and digital lifestyle need to blend into a user experience.
 
2025AD: Could you give an example of how the user experience could be further improved?
Hudi: If you have an iPhone, iPad and Macbook, you can synchronize your settings over the cloud for the entire device family. Vehicles today can be personalized in manifold ways. But if you buy or rent a car of the same type, wouldn’t it be nice if the vehicle could take your personal configuration from the cloud as well? That is something that we are working on.

2025AD: Audi established the Progressive SemiConductor Program in 2010, a far-reaching cooperation with the semiconductor industry. Why is this technology so important for automated driving?
Hudi: 80 percent of the innovations in cars are directly or indirectly connected to semiconductors. Today’s premium cars feature roughly 6,000 semiconductors. We are cooperating with the world’s leading semiconductor developers. We communicate with them at an early stage of the development process. If a chip is suitable for an application in our vehicles it will get a specific automotive qualification.
 
2025AD: The semiconductor industry has significantly shorter production cycles than the car industry. How can they cooperate with each other?
Hudi: We have developed systems that are modular. Take Audi’s infotainment system: some parts have short and some have longer lifespans. Everything that concerns connectivity, navigation or voice control has a short lifespan, for instance. With our Modular Infotainment Platform, we are able to separate the short-lived from the long-lived parts. This way we can introduce innovations in consumer electronics much faster.
 
2025AD: How does the user benefit?
Hudi: In 2014, we introduced a virtual cockpit in the Audi TT for the first time. Two years later, we are offering this virtual cockpit for almost every model. Such a pace would not have been possible without our program.
 
2025AD: If we look ten years ahead: how will automated driving change our mobility?
Hudi: My personal vision is that in 10 to 15 years, car manufacturers will offer premium flat rates. For, let’s say, 1,500 Euros a month I will be able to use every vehicle of Audi’s product range. I will simply summon the cars with my smartphone. At the Sunday breakfast table, I will check my schedule for the week. Maybe I would like a Q5 to drive to work on weekdays. On Wednesday evening I have a business dinner, so why not take an A6? And on the weekend I want to go on a trip with my family so I order a Q7. The car picks me up at my home just in time, fully autonomously, fully electric and fully charged. At the office, I leave the car before it parks itself. The car is always there when I need it and it leaves when I don’t need it.
 
2025AD: If OEMs become providers of such flat rate models, doesn’t this fundamentally alter the self-perception of this traditional industry?
Hudi: Indeed. But in the future it will be a key success driver to build a high-grade product system around our high-grade core product. Again, Apple is a good example: its devices are of high quality and easy to operate. But what would an iPhone be without iTunes or the App Store?
 
2025AD: Audi is a car manufacturer that promotes the fun of driving. In the long term, do you think sporty driving will become a niche business?
Hudi: In my opinion there will always be situations where people will say: I want to experience this sporty vehicle and drive myself. I want to drive down a beautiful road and enjoy the perfection of a vehicle. It will not be an either-or decision. It will the best of both worlds.
 


[Update, August 23: In a press release, Audi has announced that Ricky Hudi is leaving the company at his own request after 19 years. Hudi will found and lead his own technology and consulting firm. Among others, he will  provide consulting for the location platform company HERE, in which Audi has invested. Dr. Thomas M. Müller will be the new Head of Electrics/Electronics of Audi.]

We think it is, very slowly, with examples like the Lilium Jet and Waymo’s driverless car the closest things we have to autonomous vehicles (one of which flys) that mirror the movies, and actually physically exists. Now, we’re asking what has changed (if anything) since we last talked about fictional autonomous vehicles in 2019, and if we’re any closer to what we see on screen.
 
The smart tech: driverless cars and air taxis
Has it come true? Kind of…
 
Series three of Westworld has been a lockdown saviour for many sci-fi fans, but the tech-filled western has traded dusty towns and bionic horses for sleek futuristic cities and fully level-5 driverless vehicles.
 
Creator Jonathan Nolan’s incredible dystopian future where drivers aren’t anywhere to be seen has been highly praised by critics and future-thinkers, but the vision and execution is completely founded in current futurism.
 
According to Nolan, who also fully believes driverless cars will be the norm in the not-too-distant future, all of the concepts and designs are built on what we kind of know, and what we can roughly expect. Yes, the almost all-glass, suicide-doored Audi that ferries Dolores around in some scenes is actually a year-old Audi Aicon concept car, and even the incredible e-VTOL that takes off and lands at Delos HQ isn’t actually too sci-fi – maybe just a slight upgrade of Lilium’s incredible ‘flying taxi’ (we spoke to the designer of the Lilium Jet e-VTOL Frank Stephenson earlier this year).
 
Although the show is certainly set in a time where humanoid robots are commonplace, the tech still feels very familiar.

The driverless tech: driverless ambulances
Is it new? For movies and TV, yes, sort of.
Has it come true? We’re getting there
 
One of the stand-out driverless vehicles used in Westworld for us however is the driverless ambulance from episode three.
 
Think this sounds futuristic? Nope. A team in Hungary have already carried out a study into patients’ willingness to get taken to hospital in a driverless ambulance, and a team at Caltech have already designed and hypothesised a driverless air ambulance that goes above and beyond the Westworld team’s imagination.
 
The driverless tech: driverless motorcycle
Is it new for the movies? Yep, we haven’t seen anything that cool before
Has it come true? No, but we don’t think it will be too long
 
Nolan’s commitment to making stuff that’s still fairly recognisable leaves us with some shiny new driverless tech to fawn over, but even the fully autonomous bike that doubles up as a weapon is already science fact.

Altered Carbon, the 2017 Netflix series which brought us Fifth-Element-esque flying driverless cars, traded futuristic transport and cityscapes for far away worlds. Driverless spaceships are alluded to, but the tech that stops mega structures hurtling through space from colliding with each other doesn’t get much screen time.
 
And although we do have unmanned vehicle ferrying supplies and people up to the International Space Station, they’re still under full control of humans for 99% of the time, so we’re still quite far off spacecraft that can make their own decisions.






      Altered Carbon’s megastructures are certainly exciting, but the tech behind them doesn’t get much of an outing
    




The smart tech: flying, semi-autonomous car with human control
Has it come true? Well, yeah, except for the flying part
 
Even the incredible Lexus RC F that appeared in Men in Black International last year, a slick upgrade of the Ford Crown Victoria seen in the original films, was ho-hum from a driverless perspective.
 
Yes, it could convert into a flying car, and yes, the red button made for probably the best sports mode in the universe, but where was the fun ‘autopilot’ from the first Men in Black movie? And with all that alien tech, how come Agent H still had to hold the wheel for most of the film? That technology definitely already exists! Even the driverless ‘hyperloop’ style vehicle that Agent M rides in is nothing new either.

Have we hit a fictional driverless car plateau?
The smart tech:Ultra-realistic driverless cars, and the incredible infrastructure
Has it come true? Not even close
 
The last time we visited driverless vehicles on screen, trend-setters like Minority Report and I, Robot created driverless cars and driverless infrastructure that were not only way ahead of their time, but are still the most talked about portrayals of driverless cars to this day.
 
Almost two decades on, it seems we’re just repeating the same ideas. These movies are way more memorable than anything mentioned so far in this article.
 
There could be three factors for this lack of innovation; something we really haven’t seen before being dreamt up by writers and set designers.
 

Are we at a point where driverless cars are so close, they’ve stopped being a sci-fi fantasy?
Is our interest in driverless cars waning?
Are Hollywood directors becoming lazy?

For us, it could be a bit of all three. We’re still waiting for a ‘real’, level three driverless car to hit the market, something which should be happening in the next five years even though this was regarded as overpromising by most from the beginning. Maybe we got bored of waiting, and 007’s old, manual DB9 is more exciting right now?
 
 
 






      Minority Report’s visionary highways just haven’t been matched
    




Is driverless close enough to make it less exciting than fantasy?
On the other side of the coin, we’re also seeing plenty of ‘driverless’ cars, buses, trains and other vehicles appearing in cities across the world, even if the limits are severe and the level of autonomy restricted. We’re certainly a lot closer now than 12 months ago, but we’re still very much in the ‘tech phase’, which means we’re getting there, but the progress isn’t as exciting as futuristic shapes and cutting-interior updates. However, if it exists, even in a slightly duller form, it’s not really sci-fi anymore.
 
Maybe movie makers just don’t feel driverless cars are as ‘cool’ as they were when Tom Cruise was battling his way across a 20-something lane highway on the side of a skyscraper in Minority report. Perhaps the image of a student tapping away at a laptop in the passenger seat, as a family car makes its way around a testing course at 20km/h just isn’t getting filmmakers, and therefore audiences excited?
 






      We feel all the stuff on the roof would just get in the way during a car chase…
    




However, we still think filmmakers are being a little lazy. Where are the human-friendly, tech-packed interiors designed for work, rest and play seen in the already-existent driverless cars like the Cruise Origin?
 
Or maybe it’s because we’ve actually caught up with our futuristic fantasies. If driverless technology advances are outstripping our imaginations, then what should filmmakers be thinking about next? Teleportation?
 
Have we missed any fictional driverless cars from the last 12 months? Have you got any great driverless technology ideas that would enhance a movie? Let us know your opinion in the comments section or on our social media channels

,Autonomous driving explained,"What do we mean when we talk about driverless cars, self-driving cars or what some people call automated driving or autonomous driving?

Are we talking about vehicles that drive themselves, without a human on board? Or do we mean vehicles that merely take over some things that humans do now, like braking and steering?
Now, achieving a world in which fully autonomous driving is commonplace will not happen overnight. It will be a slow process, through which the cars gradually evolve to drive themselves piece-by-piece, with less-and-less need for human interaction. Therefore, we need different terms for the different levels of automation.
This is an overview of each of those

Five levels of autonomous driving
In 2014, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) created six definitions that describe different levels of automation. As you can see from the table below, the SAE assigns a ‘zero’ to no automation, although most modern cars operate with a driver assistance system of some sort, making ‘zero’ unusual. 
Level 5 means full automation (cars that drive themselves, without needing a driver on board). The other levels sit between these two extremes.
Unfortunately, not every institution agrees exactly with the SAE. The good news is that there is a lot of overlap between the definitions of all major automotive associations. The following table sets out the different levels of automation.

Our definitions of autonomous driving
At 2025AD, we use the following definitions:

Level 4: “fully automated driving” (in certain driving scenarios)
Level 5: “driverless”, “autonomous” or “self-driving”    

We do this to distinguish whether or not a driver will be needed on board to intervene, or not.
 
 
Autonomous driving level 4 explained
We are sure level 4 is achievable by the year 2025 (hence our name). At level 4, the human driver can hand over full control to the vehicle in certain situations. For example, the driver could watch TV while cruising down the motorway without ‘driving’, because the vehicle is doing this itself.
However, at level 4, the human driver must be in the vehicle, ready to intervene should they need to. The human driver can also hit an ‘off-button’ at level 4 and drive manually.
 
 
Autonomous driving level 5 in explained
Level 5 vehicles drive themselves, without needing humans on board. Like most experts, we do not see this being achieved within the next 15 years. We know that some low-speed tests have taken place on private roads, but this does not mean it will happen on public roads soon.

Different terms for autonomous driving
Not everyone agrees with us. Some of our interview partners, guest authors, users and people quoted from other sources may define autonomous driving slightly differently from 2025AD. We aim to make this clear in all our articles.
